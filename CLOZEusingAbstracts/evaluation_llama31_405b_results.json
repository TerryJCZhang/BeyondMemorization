The results for the [blank2] algorithms are all new, and we expect that these fundamental results on the stochastic processes underlying these algorithms will have wider applicability in future. Overall our results show that the differences in [blank3] performance of the three algorithms are fairly small but still important. However, the differences in [blank4] are much greater.

This remarkable principle was recently discovered to be true for smooth functions on compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary. Our main result extends the principle to the noncompact Euclidean space stated for [blank3] under suitable decay conditions at infinity. We also present applications of this principle to solve new inverse problems for recovering anisotropic principal terms as well as zeroth order coefficients in fractional polyharmonic equations. Our proof of the entanglement principle uses the [blank4] of fractional Laplacian to establish connections between the principle and the study of several topics including interpolation properties for holomorphic functions under certain growth conditions at infinity, meromorphic extensions of holomorphic functions from a subdomain, as well as support theorems for [blank5] on \\mathbb R^n that are defined as averages of functions over spheres.",

In some cases it is required to represent such a vector with only b bits per entry. A natural choice is to partition the interval [0,1] into [blank2] and quantize entries to each bin independently. We show that a minor modification of this procedure -- applying an [blank3] prior to quantization -- yields an extremely effective quantization method. For example, for b=8 (16) and 10^5-sized alphabets, the quality of representation improves from a loss (under [blank4]) of 0.5 (0.1) bits/entry to 10^{-4} (10^{-9}) bits/entry.

Unlike a traditional jammer, we assume a [blank1] capable of detecting pre-existing countermeasures and subsequently changing the target frequency band. To facilitate reliable communication amidst a strong adversary, we propose a [blank2] wherein the victim uses a helper in its vicinity to fast-forward its messages to the base station, in addition to ensuring that the countermeasures are undetected by the FD adversary. Towards designing the [blank3] for the proposed scheme, we identify that existing [blank3] for fast-fading channels are not applicable owing to the cooperative nature of the fast-forward scheme. As a result, we formulate an optimization problem of designing the non-coherent constellations at the victim and the helper such that the [blank4] at the base station is minimized. We theoretically analyze the optimization problem and propose several strategies to compute near-optimal constellations based on the helper's data-rate and fast-forwarding abilities. We show that the proposed constellations provide near-optimal error performance and help the victim evade jamming. Finally, we also prove the scheme's efficacy in deceiving the [blank5] at the jammer.",

    "cloze_question": "A classic problem in data analysis is studying the systems of subsets defined by either a similarity or a dissimilarity function on X which is either observed directly or derived from a data set. For an electrical network there are two functions on the set of the nodes defined by the [blank1] and the [blank2] either of which defines the network completely. We argue that these functions should be viewed as a similarity and a dissimilarity function on the set of the nodes; moreover they are related via the [blank3] also known as the Farris transform or the Gromov product. We will explore the properties of electrical networks from this point of view. It has been known for a while that the resistance matrix defines a metric on the nodes of the electrical networks. Moreover for a circular electrical network this metric obeys the Kalmanson property as it was shown recently. We will call such a metric an [blank4]. The main results of this paper is a complete description of the electrical Kalmanson metrics in the set of all Kalmanson metrics in terms of the geometry of the [blank5] whose connection to the theory of electrical networks was discovered earlier. One important area of applications where Kalmanson metrics are actively used is the theory of phylogenetic networks which are a generalization of phylogenetic trees. Our results allow us to use in phylogenetics the powerful methods of reconstruction of the minimal graphs of electrical networks and possibly open the door into data analysis for the methods of the theory of cluster algebras.",

We focus on Y being a [blank2] having a transition density: We analyze properties of the [blank3] p of the process X. We establish a series representation of p. We prove its convergence as time goes to infinity ([blank4]), and we show that the limit rho_Y (density of the ergodic measure) can be expressed by means of the transition density of the process Y starting from zero, which results in closed concise formulae for its moments. We show that the process X reaches a [blank5]. Furthermore, we check that p satisfies the Fokker--Planck equation, and we confirm the harmonicity of rho_Y with respect to the adjoint generator. In detail, we discuss the following cases: Brownian motion, isotropic and d-cylindrical alpha-stable processes for alpha in (0,2), and alpha-stable subordinator for alpha in (0,1). We find the asymptotic behavior of p(t;x,y) as t-> +infinity while (t,y) stays in a certain space-time region.

    "cloze_question": "What use can there be for a function from the p-adic numbers to the q-adic numbers, where p and q are distinct primes? The traditional answer, courtesy of the half-century old theory of [blank1]: not much. It turns out this judgment was premature. '[blank2]' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous [blank3] and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map H:Z→Z, one can construct a function χ_H:Z_p→Z_q for an appropriate choice of distinct primes p,q with the property that x in Z\\{0} is a periodic point of H if and only if there is a p-adic integer z in (Q∩Z_p)\\{0,1,2,...} so that χ_H(z)=x. By generalizing [blank4] and establishing a (p,q)-adic analogue of the [blank5], one can show that the question 'is x in Z\\{0} a periodic point of H?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of χ_H(z)-x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice Z^d for any d≥1.",

The first, which we call \"[blank1]\", are defined on [blank2], and lift to [blank3]. The second, the \"[blank4]\", are defined on unitary Shimura varieties in characteristic p only, and generalize the foliations studied by us before, when the CM field in question was quadratic imaginary. We determine when these foliations are p-closed, and the locus where they are smooth. Where not smooth, we construct a \"successive blow up\" of our Shimura variety to which they extend as smooth foliations. We discuss some integral varieties of the foliations. We relate the quotient of S by the foliation to a purely inseparable map from a certain component of another Shimura variety of the same type, with [blank5] at p, to S.",

Venturing into the transductive learning landscape, we, for the first time, pinpoint the [blank3] for the exact recovery of all test nodes in CSBM. Concurrently, we design an optimal spectral estimator inspired by [blank4] with the training labels and essential data from both the adjacency matrix and feature vectors. We also evaluate the efficacy of graph ridge regression and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) on this synthetic dataset. Our findings underscore that graph ridge regression and GCN possess the ability to achieve the information threshold of exact recovery in a manner akin to the optimal estimator when using the [blank5]. This highlights the potential role of feature learning in augmenting the proficiency of GCN, especially in the realm of semi-supervised learning.",

On this basis, the fundamental secrecy performance limits achieved by CAPAs are analyzed by deriving closed-form expressions for the [blank4] and minimum required power (MRP), along with the corresponding optimal current distributions. To provide further insights, asymptotic analyses are performed for the MSR and MRP, which reveals that i) for the MSR, the optimal current distribution simplifies to [blank5] beamforming in the low-SNR regime and to zero-forcing beamforming in the high-SNR regime; i) for the MRP, the optimal current distribution simplifies to zero-forcing beamforming in the high-SNR regime. The derived results are specialized to the typical array structures, e.g., planar CAPAs and planar spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). The rate and power scaling laws are further analyzed by assuming an infinitely large CAPA.

We focus on \\mathbf{Y} being a [blank3] having a transition density: We analyze properties of the transition density p of the process \\mathbf{X}. We establish a series representation of p. We prove its convergence as time goes to infinity ([blank4]), and we show that the limit \\rho_{\\mathbf{Y}} (density of the ergodic measure) can be expressed by means of the transition density of the process \\mathbf{Y} starting from zero, which results in closed concise formulae for its moments. We show that the process \\mathbf{X} reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, we check that p satisfies the [blank5], and we confirm the harmonicity of \\rho_{\\mathbf{Y}} with respect to the adjoint generator. In detail, we discuss the following cases: Brownian motion, isotropic and d-cylindrical \\alpha-stable processes for \\alpha \\in (0,2), and \\alpha-stable subordinator for \\alpha\\in (0,1).

In general the latter exhibit a structured form of the [blank2]. Specialising to the case of Dyson Brownian motion from the identity on U(N) allows the moments of the spectral density, and the [blank3] S_N(k;t), to be evaluated explicitly in terms of a certain hypergeometric polynomial. Upon transformation, this can be identified in terms of a [blank4] with parameters (N(μ − 1),1), where μ = k/N and k is the integer labelling the Fourier coefficients. From existing results in the literature for the asymptotics of the latter, the asymptotic forms of the moments of the spectral density can be specified, as can lim_{N → ∞} {1 \n  N} S_N(k;t) |_{μ = k/N}. These in turn allow us to give a quantitative description of the large N behaviour of the average ⟨ | ∑_{l=1}^N e^{ i k x_l} |^2 ⟩. The latter exhibits a [blank5] effect, which is attracting recent interest from the viewpoints of many body quantum chaos, and the scrambling of information in black holes.",

The [blank2] of an infinite word is a function that maps the integer n ≥ 0 to the number of k-binomial equivalence classes represented by its factors of length n. The [blank3] and its generalization to larger alphabets are ubiquitous in mathematics due to their rich combinatorial properties. This work addresses the k-binomial complexities of generalized TM words. Prior research by Lejeune, Leroy, and Rigo determined the k-binomial complexities of the 2-letter TM word. For larger alphabets, work by Lü, Chen, Wen, and Wu determined the 2-binomial complexity for m-letter TM words, for arbitrary m, but the exact behavior for k ≥ 3 remained unresolved. They conjectured that the k-binomial complexity function of the m-letter TM word is [blank4]. We resolve the conjecture positively by deriving explicit formulae for the k-binomial complexity functions for any generalized TM word. We do this by characterizing k-binomial equivalence among factors of generalized TM words. This comprehensive analysis not only solves the open conjecture, but also develops tools such as [blank5].",

The well-posedness of the constrained problem is obtained by letting the penalty parameter to tend to zero. Energy estimates `a la [blank5] are derived accounting for delay. Thanks to these estimates and the convexity of the constraints, we obtain compactness uniformly with respect to the discretisation step and the parameter, this is the mathematically involved part of the article.

Drawing inspiration from recent techniques like [blank3], our method constructs train-test data pairs using externally generated Gaussian randomization variables. The key innovation lies in a carefully designed correlation structure among the randomization variables, which we refer to as [blank4]. In theory, we show that this correlation is crucial in ensuring that the [blank5] while allowing the bias to vanish.

Using the theory of Markov chains of random walks and the [blank3], it was proved that the [blank4] (second smallest Laplacian eigenvalues) of G and F_k(G) coincide, but a combinatorial/algebraic proof has been shown elusive. In this paper, we use the latter approach and prove that such equality holds for different new classes of graphs under perturbations, such as extended cycles, extended complete bipartite graphs, [blank5], and graphs with a cut clique. Kite graphs are formed by a graph (head) with several paths (tail) rooted at the same vertex and with exciting properties. For instance, we show that the different eigenvalues of a kite graph are also eigenvalues of its perturbed graph obtained by adding edges. Moreover, as a particular case of one of our theorems, we generalize a recent result of Barik and Verma about graphs with a cut vertex of degree n-1. Along the way, we give conditions under which the perturbed graph G+uv, with uv in E, has the same algebraic connectivity as G.",

    "cloze_question": "Recently, Allen, Grove, Long, and Tu proposed an explicit [blank1] which gives a concrete link between certain hypergeometric objects and modular forms. The theory is exemplified by a collection of 199 [blank2]. Among other properties their process shows that the [blank3] is an explicit multiple of a hypergeometric series. Using the framework of a [blank4] governing the invariance group of normalized hypergeometric series, this paper fully classifies and describes the possible [blank5] whose L-values can be obtained using this method. In addition, we determine when these modular forms differ by twist of a finite-order character using the perspective of hypergeometric functions. As one application, we reinterpret a classical identity of hypergeometric series as a formula involving L-values of two Hecke eigenforms that differ by a twist.",

    "cloze_question": "With potential applications to short-packet communication, we address communication of low-latency messages in fast-fading channels under the presence of a [blank1]. Unlike a traditional jammer, we assume a [blank2] capable of detecting pre-existing countermeasures and subsequently changing the target frequency band. To facilitate reliable communication amidst a strong adversary, we propose a [blank3] wherein the victim uses a helper in its vicinity to fast-forward its messages to the base station, in addition to ensuring that the countermeasures are undetected by the FD adversary. Towards designing the constellations for the proposed scheme, we identify that existing non-coherent constellation for fast-fading channels are not applicable owing to the cooperative nature of the fast-forward scheme. As a result, we formulate an optimization problem of designing the non-coherent constellations at the victim and the helper such that the [blank4] at the base station is minimized. We theoretically analyze the optimization problem and propose several strategies to compute near-optimal constellations based on the helper's data-rate and fast-forwarding abilities. We show that the proposed constellations provide near-optimal error performance and help the victim evade jamming. Finally, we also prove the scheme's efficacy in deceiving the [blank5] at the jammer.",

'[blank3]-adic analysis' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous [blank3] and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map H:Z→Z, one can construct a function χ_H:Z_p→Z_q for an appropriate choice of distinct primes p,q with the property that x∈Z\\{0} is a periodic point of H if and only if there is a p-adic integer z∈(Q∩Z_p)\\{0,1,2,...} so that χ_H(z)=x. By generalizing [blank4] and establishing a [blank5] of the p,q-adic analogue, one can show that the question 'is x∈Z\\{0} a periodic point of H?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of χ_H(z)-x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice Z^d for any d≥1.",

The traditional answer, courtesy of the half-century old theory of non-archimedean functional analysis: not much. It turns out this judgment was premature. '[blank1]' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous [blank2] and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map H:Z→Z, one can construct a function χ_H:Z_p→Z_q for an appropriate choice of distinct primes p,q with the property that x∈Z\\{0} is a periodic point of H if and only if there is a [blank3] z∈(Q∩Z_p)\\{0,1,2,...} so that χ_H(z)=x. By generalizing [blank4] and establishing a [blank5] of the p,q-adic analogue, one can show that the question 'is x∈Z\\{0} a periodic point of H?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of χ_H(z)-x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice Z^d for any d≥1.",

The expressive power of neural gates (number of distinct functions it can compute) depends on the weight sizes and, in general, large weights (exponential in the number of inputs) are required. Studying the trade-offs among the weight sizes, circuit size and depth is a well-studied topic both in circuit complexity theory and the practice of neural computation. We propose a new approach for studying these complexity trade-offs by considering a related [blank1]. Specifically, given a single linear equation with arbitrary coefficients, we would like to express it using a system of linear equations with smaller (even constant) coefficients. The techniques we developed are based on [blank2] for the bounds, [blank3] for the existential results and extensions of [blank4] for the constructions. We explicitly construct a constant weight, optimal size matrix to compute the [blank5] (checking if two integers expressed in binary are equal). Computing EQUALITY with a single linear equation requires exponentially large weights. In addition, we prove the existence of the best-known weight size (linear) matrices to compute the COMPARISON function (comparing between two integers expressed in binary). In the context of the circuit complexity theory, our results improve the upper bounds on the weight sizes for the best-known circuit sizes for EQUALITY and COMPARISON.",

The traditional answer, courtesy of the half-century old theory of non-archimedean functional analysis: not much. It turns out this judgment was premature. '[blank1]' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous [blank2] and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map H:Z→Z, one can construct a function χ_H:Z_p→Z_q for an appropriate choice of distinct primes p,q with the property that x∈Z\\{0} is a periodic point of H if and only if there is a [blank3] z∈(Q∩Z_p)\\{0,1,2,...} so that χ_H(z)=x. By generalizing [blank4] and establishing a [blank5] of the p q-adic analogue, one can show that the question 'is x∈Z\\{0} a periodic point of H?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of χ_H(z)-x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice Z^d for any d≥1.",

    "cloze_question": "[blank1] (FW) are popular first-order methods for solving [blank2] that rely on a [blank3] instead of potentially expensive projection-like oracles. Many works have identified accelerated convergence rates under various structural assumptions on the optimization problem and for specific FW variants when using line-search or short-step, requiring feedback from the objective function. Little is known about accelerated convergence regimes when utilizing [blank4], a.k.a. FW with pre-determined step-sizes, which are algorithmically extremely simple and stable. Not only is FW with open-loop step-size rules not always subject to the same convergence rate lower bounds as FW with line-search or short-step, but in some specific cases, such as [blank5] in infinite dimensions, it has been empirically observed that FW with open-loop step-size rules enjoys to faster convergence rates than FW with line-search or short-step. We propose a partial answer to this unexplained phenomenon in kernel herding, characterize a general setting for which FW with open-loop step-size rules converges non-asymptotically faster than with line-search or short-step, and derive several accelerated convergence results for FW with open-loop step-size rules. Finally, we demonstrate that FW with open-loop step-sizes can compete with momentum-based open-loop FW variants.",

    "cloze_question": "By a [blank1] we mean a function f: Z^n -> Z such that f(d) is equals 0 for d_1+...+d_n sufficiently small, and equals d_1+...+d_n+C for a constant, C, for d_1+...+d_n sufficiently large. By adding 1 to the [blank2] of a graph, one gets an equivalent Riemann function, and similarly for related rank functions. To each Riemann function we associate a related function W: Z^n -> Z via [blank3] that we call the [blank4] of the Riemann function. We give evidence that the [blank4] seems to organize the structure of a Riemann function in a simpler way: first, a Riemann function f satisfies a Riemann-Roch formula iff its [blank4] satisfies a simpler symmetry condition. Second, we will calculate the [blank4] of the [blank2] for certain graphs and show that the [blank4] is quite simple to describe; we do this for graphs on two vertices and for the [blank5]. For the [blank5], we build on the work of Cori and Le Borgne who gave a linear time method to compute the [blank2] of the [blank5]. The associated [blank4] has a simple formula and is extremely sparse (i.e., mostly zero). Our computation of the [blank4] leads to another linear time algorithm to compute the [blank2], via a formula likely related to one of Cori and Le Borgne, but seemingly simpler. Our study of [blank4] leads to a natural generalization of Riemann functions, with many of the same properties exhibited by Riemann functions.",

Using the theory of Markov chains of random walks and the [blank3], it was proved that the [blank4] (second smallest Laplacian eigenvalues) of G and F_k(G) coincide, but a combinatorial/algebraic proof has been shown elusive. In this paper, we use the latter approach and prove that such equality holds for different new classes of graphs under perturbations, such as extended cycles, extended complete bipartite graphs, [blank5], and graphs with a cut clique. Kite graphs are formed by a graph (head) with several paths (tail) rooted at the same vertex and with exciting properties. For instance, we show that the different eigenvalues of a kite graph are also eigenvalues of its perturbed graph obtained by adding edges. Moreover, as a particular case of one of our theorems, we generalize a recent result of Barik and Verma about graphs with a cut vertex of degree n-1. Along the way, we give conditions under which the perturbed graph G+uv, with uv in E, has the same algebraic connectivity as G.",

Taking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as the problem of finding the [blank1] using a prespecified [blank2], minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This perspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing methods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then propose [blank3], an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of [blank4] in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically distributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical aggregation techniques, showing that [blank3] achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase.

    "cloze_question": "A continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based secure transmission framework is proposed to enhance physical layer security. Continuous current distributions, or [blank1], are designed to maximize the secrecy transmission rate under a [blank2] constraint and to minimize the required transmission power for achieving a specific target secrecy rate. On this basis, the fundamental secrecy performance limits achieved by CAPAs are analyzed by deriving closed-form expressions for the maximum secrecy rate (MSR) and minimum required power (MRP), along with the corresponding optimal [blank3]. To provide further insights, asymptotic analyses are performed for the MSR and MRP, which reveals that i) for the MSR, the optimal current distribution simplifies to [blank4] beamforming in the low-SNR regime and to [blank5] beamforming in the high-SNR regime; i) for the MRP, the optimal current distribution simplifies to ZF beamforming in the high-SNR regime. The derived results are specialized to the typical array structures, e.g., planar CAPAs and planar spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). The rate and power scaling laws are further analyzed by assuming an infinitely large CAPA. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed secure continuous beamforming design outperforms MRT and ZF beamforming in terms of both achievable secrecy rate and power efficiency; ii) CAPAs achieve superior secrecy performance compared to conventional SPDAs.",

To exemplify how this works, after reviewing the presentation of conformal 4-point correlation functions via [blank2] for the corresponding symmetric pair, we for the first time provide a complete analysis of the [blank3] radial part decomposition in the case of [blank4].

The [blank2] of S is the smallest convex set containing S. The [blank3] of G, denoted by hn_cc(G), is the cardinality of the smallest set S such that the convex hull of S is V(G). The convexity number of G, denoted by C_cc(G), is the maximum cardinality of a proper convex set of V(G). This paper studies cycle convexity in graph products. We show that the cycle hull number is always [blank4] for strong and lexicographic products. For the Cartesian, we establish tight bounds for this product and provide a closed formula when the factors are trees, generalizing an existing result for grid graphs. In addition, given a graph G and an integer k, we prove that hn_cc(G) \\leq k is [blank5] even if G is a bipartite Cartesian product graph, addressing an open question in the literature. Furthermore, we present exact formulas for the cycle convexity number in those three graph products.

This paper extends the concept of [blank3] by introducing two new variants: [blank4] and substructure fault diameter, derived from [blank1] and [blank2] respectively. For a connected graph G with W-structure connectivity κ(G;W) or W-substructure connectivity κ^s(G;W), the W-structure fault diameter D_f(G;W) and W-substructure fault diameter D_f^s(G;W) are defined as the maximum diameter of any subgraph of G resulting from removing fewer than κ(G;W)-1 W-structures or κ^s(G;W)-1 W-substructures. For the [blank5] with n ≥ 3 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n - 2, we determine both D_f(Q_n;Q_m) and D_f^s(Q_n;Q_1).

To facilitate reliable communication amidst a strong adversary, we propose a [blank2] wherein the victim uses a helper in its vicinity to fast-forward its messages to the base station, in addition to ensuring that the countermeasures are undetected by the [blank1]. Towards designing the [blank3] for the proposed scheme, we identify that existing [blank3] for fast-fading channels are not applicable owing to the cooperative nature of the fast-forward scheme. As a result, we formulate an optimization problem of designing the non-coherent constellations at the victim and the helper such that the [blank4] at the base station is minimized. We theoretically analyze the optimization problem and propose several strategies to compute near-optimal constellations based on the helper's data-rate and fast-forwarding abilities. We show that the proposed constellations provide near-optimal error performance and help the victim evade jamming.

Motivated by this interest in 321-avoiding shallow permutations, we investigate σ-avoiding shallow permutations for all σ in S3. To do this, we develop more general structural results about shallow permutations, and apply them to enumerate shallow permutations avoiding any pattern of length 3.",

The core idea is that when two neighboring agents whose distance between local estimates is the largest among all neighboring agents in the network average their states, it leads to the largest possible immediate reduction of the [blank4] used to establish convergence to the set of optimal solutions.

To do this, we compute limiting distributions of the outcomes for an arbitrary agent whose initial relative position in the tiebreak order is θ∈[0,1], as a function of θ. The results for the Boston algorithms are all new, and we expect that these fundamental results on the stochastic processes underlying these algorithms will have wider applicability in future. Overall our results show that the differences in utilitarian welfare performance of the three algorithms are fairly small but still important. However, the differences in order bias are much greater.

The [blank2] of an infinite word is a function that maps the integer n≥0 to the number of k-binomial equivalence classes represented by its factors of length n. The Thue--Morse (TM) word and its generalization to larger alphabets are ubiquitous in mathematics due to their rich combinatorial properties. This work addresses the k-binomial complexities of [blank3]. Prior research by Lejeune, Leroy, and Rigo determined the k-binomial complexities of the 2-letter TM word. For larger alphabets, work by L\"u, Chen, Wen, and Wu determined the 2-binomial complexity for m-letter TM words, for arbitrary m, but the exact behavior for k≥3 remained unresolved. They conjectured that the k-binomial complexity function of the m-letter TM word is [blank4] with period m^k. We resolve the conjecture positively by deriving explicit formulae for the k-binomial complexity functions for any generalized TM word. We do this by characterizing k-binomial equivalence among factors of generalized TM words. This comprehensive analysis not only solves the open conjecture, but also develops tools such as [blank5].",

'[blank1]' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous Collatz map and similar arithmetical dynamical systems.

If we insist on satisfying our preferences only, we may suffer a loss due to conflicts with other people's identical selections. Such a case applies when the choice cannot be divided into multiple pieces due to the intrinsic nature of the resources. Former studies, such as the [blank1], examined how to conduct fair joint decision-making while avoiding decision conflicts from the perspective of game theory when multiple players have their own deterministic preference profiles. However, in reality, [blank2] can naturally appear in relation to the stochastic decision-making of humans. Here, we theoretically derive conflict-free joint decision-making that can satisfy the [blank2] of all individual players. More specifically, we mathematically prove the conditions wherein the deviation of the resultant chance of obtaining each choice from the individual preference profile, which we call the [blank3], becomes zero, meaning that [blank4] while avoiding decision conflicts.

This paper surveys the families of parameters for which GFE has been solved. Although the proofs are not discussed here, collecting these references in one place will make it easier for the readers to find the relevant proof techniques in the original papers. Also, this survey will help the readers to avoid duplicate work by solving the already solved cases.",

    "cloze_question": "Two finite words are [blank1] if each subword (i.e., subsequence) of length at most k occurs the same number of times in both words. The [blank2] of an infinite word is a function that maps the integer n≥0 to the number of k-binomial equivalence classes represented by its factors of length n. The [blank3] (TM) word and its generalization to larger alphabets are ubiquitous in mathematics due to their rich combinatorial properties. This work addresses the k-binomial complexities of generalized TM words. Prior research by Lejeune, Leroy, and Rigo determined the k-binomial complexities of the 2-letter TM word. For larger alphabets, work by Lü, Chen, Wen, and Wu determined the 2-binomial complexity for m-letter TM words, for arbitrary m, but the exact behavior for k≥3 remained unresolved. They conjectured that the k-binomial complexity function of the m-letter TM word is [blank4] with period m^k. We resolve the conjecture positively by deriving explicit formulae for the k-binomial complexity functions for any generalized TM word. We do this by characterizing k-binomial equivalence among factors of generalized TM words. This comprehensive analysis not only solves the open conjecture, but also develops tools such as [blank5].",

It is conjectured that in Euclidean space, if the solution has a prior bound in the [blank2], that is, u \\in L_t^\\infty(I; \\dot{H}_x^{s_c}(R^3)) with s_c := 3/2 - 2/\\alpha \\in (0, 3/2), then u is global and scatters. In this paper, assuming that this conjecture holds, we prove that if u is a solution to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in exterior domain \\Omega with Dirichlet boundary condition and satisfies u \\in L_t^\\infty(I; \\dot{H}^{s_c}_D(\\Omega)) with s_c \\in [1/2, 3/2), then u is global and scatters.\n\nThe proof of the main results relies on the [blank3] of Kenig and Merle. The main difficulty is to construct minimal counterexamples when the scaling and translation invariance breakdown on \\Omega. To achieve this, two key ingredients are required. First, we adopt the approach of Killip, Visan, and Zhang to derive the [blank4] for the linear propagator e^{it\\Delta_\\Omega} in \\dot{H}^{s_c}(\\Omega). The second ingredient is the embedding of the nonlinear profiles. More precisely, we need to demonstrate that nonlinear solutions in the limiting geometries, which exhibit global spacetime bounds, can be embedded back into \\Omega. Finally, to rule out the minimal counterexamples, we will establish [blank5] for the exterior domain NLS, along with spatially localized and frequency-localized Morawetz estimates.",

The traditional answer, courtesy of the half-century old theory of [blank1]: not much. It turns out this judgment was premature. '[blank2]' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous Collatz map and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map H:Z→Z, one can construct a function χ_H:Z_p→Z_q for an appropriate choice of distinct primes p,q with the property that x∈Z\\{0} is a periodic point of H if and only if there is a [blank3] 𝔷∈(Q∩Z_p)\\{0,1,2,...} so that χ_H(𝔷)=x. By generalizing [blank4] and establishing a (p,q)-adic analogue of the [blank5], one can show that the question 'is x∈Z\\{0} a periodic point of H?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of χ_H(𝔷)-x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice Z^d for any d≥1.",

Moreover, we propose another piggybacking codes by designing n piggyback functions of some instances of (n,k) MDS code and adding the n piggyback functions into the n newly created empty entries with no data symbols.

The original properties of the [blank3] of potential meridional fields \\vec V in cylindrically layered media, where \\phi( \\rho) = \\rho^{-\\alpha} (\\alpha \\in \\mathbb R), lead to the concept of [blank4] of the first and second kind. The concept of [blank5] of the first and second kind naturally arises in this way. When \\alpha =1, the special concept of Radially holomorphic functions in \\mathbb R^3, introduced by G\"{u}rlebeck, Habetha and Spr\"{o}ssig in 2008, is developed in more detail. Certain key properties of the radially holomorphic functions G and functions reversed with respect to G are first characterized. Surprising properties of the radially holomorphic potentials represented by superposition of the radially holomorphic exponential function e^{\\breve{\\beta} x} (\\breve{\\beta} \\in \\mathbb R) and function reversed with respect to e^{\\breve{\\beta} x} are demonstrated explicitly. The basic properties of the radially holomorphic potential represented by the radially holomorphic extension of the Joukowski transformation in \\mathbb R^3 are studied.",

We give evidence that the weight seems to organize the structure of a Riemann function in a simpler way: first, a Riemann function f satisfies a Riemann-Roch formula iff its weight satisfies a simpler symmetry condition. Second, we will calculate the weight of the Baker-Norine rank for certain graphs and show that the weight function is quite simple to describe; we do this for graphs on two vertices and for the [blank5].\n  For the [blank5], we build on the work of Cori and Le Borgne who gave a linear time method to compute the Baker-Norine rank of the [blank5]. The associated weight function has a simple formula and is extremely sparse (i.e., mostly zero). Our computation of the weight function leads to another linear time algorithm to compute the Baker-Norine rank, via a formula likely related to one of Cori and Le Borgne, but seemingly simpler, namely ...\n  Our study of weight functions leads to a natural generalization of Riemann functions, with many of the same properties exhibited by Riemann functions.",

'[blank2]' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous [blank3] and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map H:Z→Z, one can construct a function χ_H:Z_p→Z_q for an appropriate choice of distinct primes p,q with the property that x∈Z\\{0} is a periodic point of H if and only if there is a p-adic integer z∈(Q∩Z_p)\\{0,1,2,...} so that χ_H(z)=x. By generalizing [blank4] and establishing a [blank5] of the Wiener Tauberian Theorem, one can show that the question 'is x∈Z\\{0} a periodic point of H?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of χ_H(z)-x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?'

Astral space is constructed to be as small as possible while still ensuring that [blank3] can be continuously extended to the new space. Although [blank2] includes all of \\mathbb{R}^n, it is not a vector space, nor even a metric space. However, it is sufficiently well-structured to allow useful and meaningful extensions of concepts of [blank4], conjugacy, and subdifferentials.

    "cloze_question": "For a symplectic toric manifold we consider [blank1] in [blank2] P_\\infty, associated to the action of a subtorus T^p\\subset T^n. The real directions in these polarizations are generated by components of the T^p moment map. Polarizations of this type can be obtained by starting at a toric Kähler polarization P_0 and then following [blank3] of toric Kähler polarizations generated by the norm square of the moment map of the torus subgroup. These geodesic rays are lifted to the quantum bundle via a [blank4] and define equivariant isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces for the Kähler polarizations and the Hilbert space for the mixed polarization. The polarizations P_\\infty give a new way of looking at the problem of unitarity in the quantization commutes with reduction with respect to the T^p-action, as follows. The prequantum operators for the components of the moment map of the T^p-action act diagonally with discrete spectrum corresponding to the integral points of the moment polytope. The Hilbert space for the quantization with respect to P_\\infty then naturally decomposes as a direct sum of the Hilbert spaces for all its quantizable coisotropic reductions which, in fact, are the [blank5] of the initial Kähler polarization P_0. This will be shown to imply that, for the polarization P_\\infty, quantization commutes unitarily with reduction. The problem of unitarity in quantization commutes with reduction for P_0 is then equivalent to the question of whether quantization in the polarization P_0 is unitarily equivalent with quantization in the polarization P_\\infty. In fact, this does not hold in general in the toric case.",

This paper extends the concept of [blank2] by introducing two new variants: [blank3] and [blank4], derived from structure connectivity and substructure connectivity respectively. For a connected graph G with W-structure connectivity κ(G;W) or W-substructure connectivity κ^s(G;W), the W-structure fault diameter D_f(G;W) and W-substructure fault diameter D_f^s(G;W) are defined as the maximum diameter of any subgraph of G resulting from removing fewer than κ(G;W)-1 W-structures or κ^s(G;W)-1 W-substructures. For the n-dimensional [blank5] with n ≥ 3 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n - 2, we determine both D_f(Q_n;Q_m) and D_f^s(Q_n;Q_1).

The expressive power of neural gates (number of distinct functions it can compute) depends on the weight sizes and, in general, large weights (exponential in the number of inputs) are required. Studying the trade-offs among the weight sizes, circuit size and depth is a well-studied topic both in circuit complexity theory and the practice of neural computation. We propose a new approach for studying these complexity trade-offs by considering a related algebraic framework. Specifically, given a single linear equation with arbitrary coefficients, we would like to express it using a system of linear equations with smaller (even constant) coefficients. The techniques we developed are based on [blank2] for the bounds, [blank3] for the existential results and extensions of [blank4] for the constructions.\n  We explicitly construct a constant weight, optimal size matrix to compute the [blank5] (checking if two integers expressed in binary are equal). Computing EQUALITY with a single linear equation requires exponentially large weights. In addition, we prove the existence of the best-known weight size (linear) matrices to compute the COMPARISON function (comparing between two integers expressed in binary). In the context of the circuit complexity theory, our results improve the upper bounds on the weight sizes for the best-known circuit sizes for EQUALITY and COMPARISON.",

    "before_cutoff": false,
    "cloze_question": "The goal of this note is to generalize [blank1] to the setting when both the covering degree and the set of marked points are infinite. A relevant class of branched coverings are [blank2] with finitely many singular values whose orbits escape to (or, more generally, accumulate \"near\") infinity. Given a branched covering f mimicking such post-singular behaviour, one wants to decide whether it is Thurston equivalent to an entire function. The answer is positive for a big class of entire function and generic escaping singular orbits.\n\nAs in the Thurston's theorem, the problem reduces to the study of the pull-back map sigma defined on the corresponding [blank3]. But, unlike in the rational case, the space is infinite-dimensional and the branching structure near infinity (which is essential singularity) is much more subtle depending on the family of functions under consideration. A general approach is possible for entire functions defined by [blank4] introduced in the article. Roughly, it implies that asymptotic tracts fill all space near infinity even when their range shrinks.\n\nThe main result provides a sufficient condition for existence in the Teichmuller space of a [blank5] which looks like a finite-dimensional compact: forgetting marked infinite tails of every orbit yields a compact set, while forgetting a long enough initial part of every orbit yields a small perturbation of the identity homeomorphism. The statement remains valid even in case of non-escaping unbounded singular orbits and allows to deduce existence of a fixed point of sigma in many relevant cases.",

    "cloze_question": "With potential applications to short-packet communication, we address communication of low-latency messages in fast-fading channels under the presence of a [blank1]. Unlike a traditional jammer, we assume a [blank1] capable of detecting pre-existing countermeasures and subsequently changing the target frequency band. To facilitate reliable communication amidst a strong adversary, we propose a [blank2] wherein the victim uses a helper in its vicinity to fast-forward its messages to the base station, in addition to ensuring that the countermeasures are undetected by the FD adversary. Towards designing the constellations for the proposed scheme, we identify that existing [blank3] for fast-fading channels are not applicable owing to the cooperative nature of the fast-forward scheme. As a result, we formulate an optimization problem of designing the non-coherent constellations at the victim and the helper such that the [blank4] at the base station is minimized. We theoretically analyze the optimization problem and propose several strategies to compute near-optimal constellations based on the helper's [blank5] and fast-forwarding abilities. We show that the proposed constellations provide near-optimal error performance and help the victim evade jamming. Finally, we also prove the scheme's efficacy in deceiving the [blank5] at the jammer.",

In this paper, we propose a new piggybacking coding design which designs the piggyback function over some instances of both (n,k) MDS code and (n,k') MDS code, when k≥k'. We show that our new piggybacking design can significantly reduce the [blank3] for single-node failures. When k=k', we design piggybacking code that is [blank4] and we show that the designed code has lower repair bandwidth for single-node failures than all existing piggybacking codes when the number of parity node r=n-k≥8 and the sub-packetization α<r. Moreover, we propose another piggybacking codes by designing n piggyback functions of some instances of (n,k) MDS code and adding the n piggyback functions into the n newly created empty entries with no data symbols. We show that our code can significantly reduce repair bandwidth for single-node failures at a cost of slightly more [blank5].

The traditional answer, courtesy of the half-century old theory of [blank2]: not much. It turns out this judgment was premature. '[blank3]' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous Collatz map and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map H: Z→Z, one can construct a function χ_H: Z_p→Z_q for an appropriate choice of distinct primes p,q with the property that x∈Z\\{0} is a periodic point of H if and only if there is a [blank4] so that χ_H(𝔷)=x. By generalizing [blank5], one can show that the question 'is x∈Z\\{0} a periodic point of H?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of χ_H(𝔷)-x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice Z^d for any d≥1.",

In their version, the robber tries to damage as many vertices as possible and the cop attempts to minimize this damage. While the [blank2] was originally studied with [blank3], it was later extended to play with multiple cops by Carlson et al. in 2021. We take a different approach by studying the [blank2] with [blank4] against one cop. Specifically, we introduce the [blank5] of a graph and obtain a variety of bounds on this parameter.

    "cloze_question": "What use can there be for a function from the $p$-adic numbers to the $q$-adic numbers, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes? The traditional answer, courtesy of the half-century old theory of [blank1]: not much. It turns out this judgment was premature. '[blank2]' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous Collatz map and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map $H:\\mathbb{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}$, one can construct a function \\chi_{H}:\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_{q}$ for an appropriate choice of distinct primes $p,q$ with the property that $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash\\{ 0\\}$ is a [blank3] of $H$ if and only if there is a $p$-adic integer \\mathfrak{z}\\in(\\mathbb{Q}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}_{p})\\backslash\\{ 0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ so that \\chi_{H}(\\mathfrak{z})=x. By generalizing [blank4] and establishing a [blank5] in the $(p,q)$-adic setting, one can show that the question 'is $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash\\{ 0\\}$ a periodic point of $H$?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of \\chi_{H}(\\mathfrak{z})-x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ for any $d\\geq1$.",

    "cloze_question": "Our concern is with Riemannian symmetric spaces Z=G/K of the non-compact type and more precisely with the Poisson transform P_λ which maps generalized functions on the boundary ∂Z to λ-eigenfunctions on Z. Special emphasis is given to a [blank1] N<G which naturally acts on both Z and ∂Z. The N-orbits on Z are parametrized by a [blank2] A=(R_{>0})^r<G (Iwasawa) and letting the level a∈A tend to 0 on a ray we retrieve N via lim_{a→0} Na as an [blank3] in ∂Z (Bruhat). For positive parameters λ the Poisson transform P_λ is defined an injective for functions f∈L^2(N) and we give a novel characterization of P_λ(L^2(N)) in terms of complex analysis. For that we view eigenfunctions φ = P_λ(f) as families (φ_a)_{a∈A} of functions on the N-orbits, i.e. φ_a(n)= φ(na) for n∈N. The general theory then tells us that there is a tube domain 𝒯=Nexp(iΛ)⊂N_ℂ such that each φ_a extends to a holomorphic function on the scaled tube 𝒯_a=Nexp(iAd(a)Λ). We define a class of N-invariant weight functions {}_λ on the tube 𝒯, rescale them for every a∈A to a weight {}_{λ, a} on 𝒯_a, and show that each φ_a lies in the [blank4] 𝒪(𝒯_a)∩L^2(𝒯_a,{}_{λ,a}). The main result of the article then describes P_λ(L^2(N)) as those eigenfunctions φ for which φ_a∈ [blank5] for all a∈A and ||φ||:=sup_{a∈A} a^{Re λ -2ρ} ||φ_a||_{𝒝_{a,λ}}<∞ holds.",

Given an elliptic curve $ E/\\mathbb{Q} $ with good ordinary reduction at $ 2 $ and $ \\lambda_2(E/\\mathbb{Q}) = 0 $, we use [blank3] to construct quadratic twists $ E^{(d)} $ such that $ \\lambda_2(E^{(d)}/\\mathbb{Q}) $ remains unchanged or increases by $ 2 $. When the [blank4] of $E^{(d)}$ is $-1$ and the [blank5] $Sha(E^{(d)}/\\mathbb{Q})[2^\\infty] $ is finite, this yields quadratic twists with Mordell--Weil rank $ 1 $. These results support the conjectural expectation that, on average, half of the quadratic twists in a family have rank $ 0 $ and half have rank $ 1 $. In the cases we consider we obtain asymptotic lower bounds for the number of twists by squarefree numbers $d\\leq X$ which match with the conjectured value up to an explicit power of $\\log X$.

Special emphasis is given to a [blank3] N<G which naturally acts on both Z and \\partial Z. The N-orbits on Z are parametrized by a torus A=(\\mathbb{R}_{>0})^r<G (Iwasawa) and letting the level a\\in A tend to 0 on a ray we retrieve N via \\lim_{a\\to 0} Na as an open dense orbit in \\partial Z (Bruhat). For positive parameters \\lambda the [blank2] is defined an injective for functions f\\in L^2(N) and we give a novel characterization of [blank2](L^2(N)) in terms of complex analysis. For that we view eigenfunctions \\phi = [blank2](f) as families (\\phi_a)_{a\\in A} of functions on the N-orbits, i.e. \\phi_a(n)= \\phi(na) for n\\in N. The general theory then tells us that there is a [blank4] T\\subset N_\\mathbb{C} such that each \\phi_a extends to a holomorphic function on the scaled tube T_a=N\\exp(i\\operatorname{Ad}(a)\\Lambda).

It presents the main results in detail, and includes numerous subsidiary observations and calculations. It is intended to be accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students with some background in hyperbolic geometry. The main result is the [blank1], which is a smooth, [blank2] between two-component complex spin vectors and spin-decorated horospheres in three-dimensional hyperbolic space. The correspondence includes constructions of [blank3], which respectively associate null flags in Minkowski spacetime to spinors, and associate horospheres to points on the future light cone. The construction is presented step by step, proceeding from spin vectors, through spaces of Hermitian matrices and Minkowski space, to various models of 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Under this correspondence, we show that the natural inner product on spinors corresponds to a 3-dimensional, complex version of [blank4], describing a distance between horospheres and their decorations. We also discuss various applications of these results. An ideal hyperbolic tetrahedron with spin-decorations at its vertices obeys a [blank5], generalising the Ptolemy equation obeyed by 2-dimensional ideal quadrilaterals. More generally we discuss how real spinors describe 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. We also discuss the relationships between spinors, horospheres, and various sets of matrices.",

Our approach relies on the existence of contractive projections preserving complete positivity from the space of completely bounded weak* continuous operators on VN(G) onto the subspace of completely bounded Fourier multipliers. We show that such projections exist in the inner amenable case. As an application, we obtain a new [blank5]. We also investigate the analogous problem for the space of completely bounded Fourier multipliers on the noncommutative L^p-spaces L^p(VN(G)), for 1 <= p <= infinity. Using Lie group theory and results stemming from the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem, we prove that second-countable unimodular finite-dimensional amenable locally compact groups admit compatible projections at p = 1 and p = infinity.

    "cloze_question": "[blank1] are growing in importance owing to their ability to generalise well in applications where the data has known underlying symmetries. Recent characterisations of a class of these networks that use [blank2] as their layers suggest that they have significant potential; however, their implementation remains challenging owing to the prohibitively expensive nature of the computations that are involved. In this work, we present a [blank3] for any equivariant weight matrix that maps between tensor power layer spaces in these networks for four groups: the symmetric, orthogonal, special orthogonal, and symplectic groups. We obtain this algorithm by developing a [blank4] based on category theory that enables us to not only express each weight matrix as a linear combination of diagrams but also makes it possible for us to use these diagrams to factor the original computation into a series of steps that are optimal. We show that this algorithm improves the Big-O time complexity with an [blank5] in comparison to a na\u0000efve matrix multiplication.",

It turns out this judgment was premature. '[blank3]'-adic analysis of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous Collatz map and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map H:Z→Z, one can construct a function χ_H:Z_p→Z_q for an appropriate choice of distinct primes p,q with the property that x∈Z\\{0} is a periodic point of H if and only if there is a p-adic integer z∈(Q∩Z_p)\\{0,1,2,…} so that χ_H(z)=x. By generalizing [blank4] and establishing a [blank5] of the p,q-adic analogue, one can show that the question 'is x∈Z\\{0} a periodic point of H?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of χ_H(z)−x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice Z^d for any d≥1.",
