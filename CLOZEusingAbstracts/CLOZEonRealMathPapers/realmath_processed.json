When $\\alpha =1$, the\nspecial concept of \\emph{Radially holomorphic functions in $\\mathbb R^3$},\nintroduced by G\\\"{u}rlebeck, Habetha and Spr\\\"{o}ssig in 2008, is developed in\nmore detail. Certain key properties of the radially holomorphic functions $G$\nand functions reversed with respect to $G$ are first characterized.

Unlike a traditional jammer, we assume a\nfull-duplex (FD) jammer capable of detecting pre-existing countermeasures and\nsubsequently changing the target frequency band. To facilitate reliable\ncommunication amidst a strong adversary, we propose non-coherent fast-forward\nfull-duplex relaying scheme wherein the victim uses a helper in its vicinity to\nfast-forward its messages to the base station, in addition to ensuring that the\ncountermeasures are undetected by the FD adversary. Towards designing the\nconstellations for the proposed scheme, we identify that existing non-coherent\nconstellation for fast-fading channels are not applicable owing to the\ncooperative nature of the fast-forward scheme. As a result, we formulate an\noptimization problem of designing the non-coherent constellations at the victim\nand the helper such that the symbol-error-probability at the base station is\nminimized. We theoretically analyze the optimization problem and propose\nseveral strategies to compute near-optimal constellations based on the helper's\ndata-rate and fast-forwarding abilities. We show that the proposed\nconstellations provide near-optimal error performance and help the victim evade\njamming.

Given such a map $H:\\mathbb{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}$, one can\nconstruct a function $\\chi_{H}:\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_{q}$ for an\nappropriate choice of distinct primes $p,q$ with the property that\n$x\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash\\left\\{ 0\\right\\} $ is a periodic point of $H$ if and\nonly if there is a $p$-adic integer\n$\\mathfrak{z}\\in\\left(\\mathbb{Q}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)\\backslash\\left\\{\n0,1,2,\\ldots\\right\\} $ so that $\\chi_{H}\\left(\\mathfrak{z}\\right)=x$. By\ngeneralizing Monna-Springer integration theory and establishing a\n$\\left(p,q\\right)$-adic analogue of the Wiener Tauberian Theorem, one can show\nthat the question 'is $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash\\left\\{ 0\\right\\} $ a periodic\npoint of $H$?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of\nthe Fourier transform of $\\chi_{H}\\left(\\mathfrak{z}\\right)-x$ dense in an\nappropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new\nfrontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study\nCollatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ for any\n$d\\geq1$."

It is conjectured that in Euclidean space,\nif the solution has a prior bound in the critical Sobolev space, that is, $u\n\\in L_t^\\infty(I; \\dot{H}_x^{s_c}(\\mathbb{R}^3))$ with $s_c := \\frac{3}{2} -\n\\frac{2}{\\alpha} \\in (0, \\frac{3}{2})$, then $u$ is global and scatters. In\nthis paper, assuming that this conjecture holds, we prove that if $u$ is a\nsolution to the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation in exterior domain $\\Omega$\nwith Dirichlet boundary condition and satisfies $u \\in L_t^\\infty(I;\n\\dot{H}^{s_c}_D(\\Omega))$ with $s_c \\in \\left[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}\\right)$,\nthen $u$ is global and scatters.\n  The proof of the main results relies on the\nconcentration-compactness/rigidity argument of Kenig and Merle [Invent. Math.\n{\\bf 166} (2006)]. The main difficulty is to construct minimal counterexamples\nwhen the scaling and translation invariance breakdown on $\\Omega$. To achieve\nthis, two key ingredients are required. First, we adopt the approach of Killip,\nVisan, and Zhang [Amer. J. Math. {\\bf 138} (2016)] to derive the linear profile\ndecomposition for the linear propagator $e^{it\\Delta_\\Omega}$ in\n$\\dot{H}^{s_c}(\\Omega)$. The second ingredient is the embedding of the\nnonlinear profiles. More precisely, we need to demonstrate that nonlinear\nsolutions in the limiting geometries, which exhibit global spacetime bounds,\ncan be embedded back into $\\Omega$. Finally, to rule out the minimal\ncounterexamples, we will establish long-time Strichartz estimates for the\nexterior domain NLS, along with spatially localized and frequency-localized\nMorawetz estimates."

For the proof, we will use this correspondence. \n\t\t\tIf we take a pair of partitions $(\\mu,\\beta)$, then during the construction of $\\lambda$, each part of $\\beta$ increases the largest part of $\\mu$ by $1$. Hence, when the whole procedure is done, the largest part of $\\mu$ is increased by the number of parts in $\\beta$. Because of that fact, we write the generating function of $\\beta$ by keeping track of the number of parts, which gives $(-zq;q^2)_\\infty$.\n\n\t\t\tThe partition $\\mu$ is an ordinary partition and the generating function of ordinary partitions such that the largest part is $M$ is given by \n\t\t\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t\t\t\\frac{q^M}{(1-q)\\ldots(1-q^M)}.\n\t\t\t\\end{align*}\n\t\t\tIf we take sum over all $M$ by keeping track of the largest  parts with the exponent of $z$, we get\n\t\t\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t\t\t\\sum_{M\\geq0}\\frac{z^Mq^M}{(1-q)\\ldots(1-q^M)}=\\sum_{M\\geq0}\\frac{(zq)^M}{(q;q)_M}=\\frac{1}{(zq;q)_\\infty}.\n\t\t\t\\end{align*}\n\t\t\tThe second identity follows from Euler's identity~\\cite{TheBlueBook}.

On this basis, the fundamental secrecy\nperformance limits achieved by CAPAs are analyzed by deriving closed-form\nexpressions for the maximum secrecy rate (MSR) and minimum required power\n(MRP), along with the corresponding optimal current distributions. To provide\nfurther insights, asymptotic analyses are performed for the MSR and MRP, which\nreveals that i) for the MSR, the optimal current distribution simplifies to\nmaximal ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming in the low-SNR regime and to\nzero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in the high-SNR regime; i) for the MRP, the\noptimal current distribution simplifies to ZF beamforming in the high-SNR\nregime. The derived results are specialized to the typical array structures,\ne.g., planar CAPAs and planar spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). The rate and\npower scaling laws are further analyzed by assuming an infinitely large CAPA.\nNumerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed secure continuous\nbeamforming design outperforms MRT and ZF beamforming in terms of both\nachievable secrecy rate and power efficiency; ii) CAPAs achieve superior\nsecrecy performance compared to conventional SPDAs."

Therefore, we only have to prove that $G''=1$.\n\nAssume that $G''>1$. Taking an appropriate quotient, we may assume that $G''$ is a minimal normal subgroup of $G$. Since $G$ is solvable, we have that $G''$ is   $p$-elementary abelian for some prime $p$. We also have that $G/G''$ is a metabelian group with $f(G/G'')\\leq 3$. Thus,   $G/G'' \\in \\{\\mathsf{S}_{3}, \\mathsf{D}_{10},\\mathsf{A}_{4},\\mathsf{D}_{14},\\mathsf{D}_{18},\\mathsf{F}_{20},\\mathsf{F}_{21},\\mathsf{F}_{52}\\}$. \n\nWe claim that we can assume that $G''$ is the unique minimal normal subgroup of $G$. Suppose that there exists $M$, a minimal normal subgroup of $G$ different of $G''$. Then $MG''/G''$ is a minimal normal subgroup of $G/G''$. On the one hand, if $G/G''\\not=D_{18}$, then the only minimal normal subgroup of $G/G''$ is $G'/G''$. Thus, $G'=M\\times G''$ and hence $G'$ is abelian, which is a contradiction. On the other hand, if $G/G''=D_{18}$, then the only possibility is that $|M|=3$. Let $\\overline{G}=G/M$ and let $\\overline{\\cdot}$ denote the image in $G/M$. We have that  $f(\\overline{G})\\leq 3$, $\\overline{G}''=\\overline{G''}=MG''/M\\cong G''/(M\\cap G'')=G''$ and  $\\overline{G}/\\overline{G}'' \\cong G/MG''\\cong \\mathsf{S}_{3}$. Therefore, $\\overline{G}$ will be one of the studied cases. So, in any case, we may assume that $G$ is the only minimal subgroup of $G$, this is $G''=S(G)$. In particular, $k(G/S(G))=k(G/G'')\\leq 7\\leq 10$ and hence this hypothesis of Theorem \\ref{Vera-Lopez2} is satisfied.\n\nSince we are assuming that $G$ is not metabelian and $f(\\mathsf{S}_4)=5>3$, we may apply Theorem \\ref{Vera-Lopez3} to deduce that $\\alpha(G)\\geq 4$. In addition, if $k(G)\\leq 11$, applying  Theorem \\ref{Vera-Lopez}, we have that the only possibility is that $G''=1$, which is a contradiction. Thus, we will assume that $k(G)\\geq 12$. As a consequence, if $4 \\leq\\alpha(G)\\leq 9$, then applying Theorem \\ref{Vera-Lopez2} we have that $f(G)>3$, which is impossible. Therefore, in the remaining, we will assume that $k(G)\\geq 12$ and $\\alpha(G)\\geq 10$.\n\nNow, we proceed to  study case by case. We study the case $G/G''=\\mathsf{A}_{4}$ and the case $G/G''\\not=\\mathsf{A}_{4}$  separately . \n\n\\underline{Case $G/G''=\\mathsf{A}_{4}$:} By Lemma  \\ref{casoA4}, if $p\\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, then $k(G)\\leq 9<12$, which is imposible. Thus, we may assume that $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $k(G)=12$.  Since $\\alpha(G)\\geq10$, we have  that $G''$ contains a unique $G$-conjugacy class of non-trivial elements. As a consequence, $|G''|\\leq 12+1=13$. We also have that $|G''|$ is a power of a prime, $p$, such that that $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Thus, the only possibilities are $|G''|\\in \\{7,13\\}$ and hence $|G|\\in \\{84,156\\}$. By Lemma \\ref{casos}, there is no group of order $84$ or $156$ with $f(G)\\leq 3$ and hence we have a contradiction.\n\n\\underline{Case $G/G''\\not=\\mathsf{A}_{4}$:} In this case $G'/G''$ is a cyclic group. We claim that  $(|G':G''|,p)=1$.  Assume that $p$ divides  $|G':G''|$.  Then $G'$ is a $p$-group and hence $G''\\subseteq \\Phi(G')$. Therefore, $G'$ is cyclic and hence it is abelian, which is a contradiction. Thus,  the claim follows.  Now, we  study separately the case $G/G''=\\mathsf{D}_{18}$ and the case $G/G''\\in  \\{\\mathsf{S}_{3},\\mathsf{D}_{10},\\mathsf{D}_{14},\\mathsf{F}_{21},\\mathsf{F}_{20},\\mathsf{F}_{52}\\}$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item \\underline{Case $G/G''=\\mathsf{D}_{18}$:} Since $p\\not=3$, we may apply Lemma \\ref{casoD18}. If $p=2$, then $k(G)\\leq 10<12$ and hence we have a contradiction. Thus, we may assume that $p$ is odd. Assume now that $p$ is an odd prime such that $p\\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. In this case $k(G)\\leq 12$. Thus, $k(G)=12$ and reasoning as in the case $G/G''=\\mathsf{A}_{4}$ we can deduce that $G''$ contains a unique $G$-conjugacy class of non-trivial elements.  It follows that $|G''|\\leq 18+1=19$, $|G''|$ must be a power of a prime, $p$, with $p\\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$  and $|G''|=\\frac{18}{|H|}+1$, where $H \\leq \\mathsf{D}_{18}$. Since there is no integer with the required properties,  we have a contradiction.\n\nAssume finally that $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. In this case $k(G)\\leq 15$. As before, we can deduce that $G''$ contains at most $4$ non-trivial conjugacy classes and hence $|G''|\\leq 4 \\cdot 18+1=73$. Therefore, $|G''|\\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31, 37, 43, 49,53, 61, 67, 73 \\}$ and hence $|G| \\in \\{126, 234, 342, 558, 666, 774, 882, 954, 1098, 1206, 1314\\}$. Applying again Lemma \\ref{casos}, we have a contradiction.\n\n\\item  \\underline{Case $G/G''\\in  \\{\\mathsf{S}_{3},\\mathsf{D}_{10},\\mathsf{D}_{14},\\mathsf{F}_{21},\\mathsf{F}_{20},\\mathsf{F}_{52}\\}$:}  Since $(|G':G''|,p)=1$, we may apply Lemma \\ref{restocasos}. Thus, if $r=|G:G'|$ and $\\chi \\in \\Irr(G|G'')$, we have that $\\Q(\\chi)\\subseteq \\Q_{rp}$. We  study the cases $r=2,3,4$ separately.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item [(i)] Case  $G/G''\\in \\{\\mathsf{S}_{3},\\mathsf{D}_{10},\\mathsf{D}_{14}\\}$:  In these cases  $|G:G'|=2$ and hence for all $\\chi \\in \\Irr(G|G'')$ we have that $\\Q(\\chi)\\subseteq \\Q_{2p}=\\Q_{p}$. Thus, $\\Irr(G|G'')$ contains at most 5 non-rational characters. We also observe that $\\Irr(G/G'')$ possesses at most $3$ non-rational character. Counting the rational characters, we have that $k(G)\\leq 3+3+5=11<12$. That is a contradiction.\n\n\\item [(ii)]  Case  $G/G''=\\mathsf{F}_{21}$:   If $\\chi \\in \\Irr(G|G'')$ then $\\Q(\\chi)\\subseteq\\Q_{3p}$. Assume first that $p\\not\\in\\{2,3\\}$. Then, $\\Q_{3p}$ contains three quadratic extensions and at most one cubic extension and one of these quadratic extensions is $\\Q_{3}$. Since we have two characters in $\\Irr(G/G'')$ whose field of values is $\\Q_{3}$ there is no character in $\\Irr(G|G'')$ whose field of values is $\\Q_{3}$. Thus, $\\Irr(G|G'')$ contains at most $2\\cdot 2+3\\cdot 1=7$ non-rational characters. Thus, $k(G)\\leq 7+4+3=14$. Since $\\Q_{3p}$ contains a cubic extension if and only if $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, we deduce that if $p\\equiv -1 \\pmod 3$, then $k(G)\\leq 11<12$. Therefore, we deduce that $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Now,  reasoning as in the case  $G/G''=\\mathsf{D}_{18}$, we may assume that $|G''|$ contains at most $3$ non-trivial $G$-conjugacy classes. Therefore, $|G''|$ is a prime power of a prime, $p$, such that $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $|G''|-1$ must be the sum of at most three divisors of $|G/G''|=21$. It follows that  $|G''|\\in \\{7,43\\}$. Applying that $(|G':G''|,p)=1$, we have that $|G''|=43$ and hence $|G|=21\\cdot 43=903$. However, by Lemma \\ref{casos}, there is no group of order $903$ with $f(G)\\leq 3$.\n\nReasoning similarly, we can deduce that if $p=2$, then $k(G)\\leq 7<12$ and hence we have a contradiction.\n\n Finally, assume that $p=3$. In this case $\\Q_{3p}=\\Q_{9}$ contains only one quadratic extension and one cubic extension. Since the unique quadratic extension of $\\Q_9$ is $\\Q_3$, we deduce that that $\\Irr(G|G'')$ contains at most $3$ non-rational characters. Thus, $k(G)\\leq 3+4+3=10<12$ and hence we have a contradiction.\n\n\\item [(iii)] Case $G/G''\\in \\{\\mathsf{F}_{20},\\mathsf{F}_{52}\\}$:  Then $G/G''=\\mathsf{F}_{4q}$ for $q \\in \\{5,13\\}$. Thus, applying Lemma \\ref{restocasos}, we have that  $\\Q(\\chi)\\subseteq \\Q_{4p}$ for every $\\chi \\in \\Irr(G|G'')$. Reasoning as in the case $G/G''=\\mathsf{F}_{21}$, we have that if $p\\not=2$, then $\\Irr(G|G'')$ contains at most $7$ non-rational characters and if $p=2$, then  $\\Irr(G|G'')$ cannot contain non-rational characters. Therefore, if $p=2$ then $k(G)\\leq 8<12$, which is a contradiction. Thus, we may assume that $p$ is an odd prime. \n\nBefore studying the remaining cases, we claim  that $|G''|\\equiv 1 \\pmod q$. Since $(|G:G''|,p)=1$, applying the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem, we have that $G''$ is complemented in $G$ by $U\\ltimes  V$, where $U$ is cyclic of order $4$ and $V$ is cyclic of order $q$. We claim that $V$ cannot fix any non-trivial element of $G''$. We have that the action of $V$ on $G''$ is coprime. Thus, by Theorem 4.34 of \\cite{Isaacs}, $G''=[G'',V]\\times C_{G''}(V)$. Since  $C_{G''}(V)\\leq G''$ is normal in $G$ and  $G''$ is minimal normal, we have that  either $C_{G''}(V)=1$ or $C_{G''}(V)=G''$. If $C_{G''}(V)=G''$, then $G'$ is abelian, which is a contradiction. Thus, $C_{G''}(V)=1$ and hence $V$ does not fix any non-trivial element in $G''$. Therefore, $|G''|\\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ as we claimed. \n\n   \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item [a)] Case $G/G''=\\mathsf{F}_{20}$: It is easy to see that $k(G)\\leq 12$. If moreover, $p\\not \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, then $k(G)\\leq 9$, which is impossible. Thus, as in case $G/G''=\\mathsf{A}_{4}$  we  may assume that $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$  and that $G''$ possesses a unique non-trivial $G$-conjugacy class. Therefore, $|G''|\\leq20+1=21$, $|G''|\\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$  and it is a power or a prime, $p$, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. We see that there is no integer with the required properties, and hence we have a contradiction.\n\n\\item [b)] Case $G/G''=\\mathsf{F}_{52}$:  It is easy to see that  $k(G)\\leq 15$.   As in  case $G/G''=\\mathsf{D}_{18}$, we may  assume that  $G''$ contains at most $4$ non-trivial  $G$-conjugacy classes. Therefore, $|G''|\\leq 4\\cdot 52+1=209$. It follows that $|G''|\\equiv 1 \\pmod {13}$, $|G''|\\leq 209$  and it  is a  power of  a prime. Thus, $|G''|\\in \\{27,53,79,131,157\\}$ and hence $|G|\\in \\{1404,2756,4108,6812,8164\\}$, which contradicts Lemma \\ref{casos}.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{itemize}\nWe conclude that $G''=1$ and the result follows.\n\\end{proof}",

Even when sample splitting is possible,\nour method offers a computationally efficient alternative for estimating the\nprediction error, achieving comparable or even lower error than standard\ncross-validation in a few train-test repetitions. Drawing inspiration from\nrecent techniques like data-fission and data-thinning, our method constructs\ntrain-test data pairs using externally generated Gaussian randomization\nvariables. The key innovation lies in a carefully designed correlation\nstructure among the randomization variables, which we refer to as antithetic\nGaussian randomization. In theory, we show that this correlation is crucial in\nensuring that the variance of our estimator remains bounded while allowing the\nbias to vanish. Through simulations on various data types and loss functions,\nwe highlight the advantages of our antithetic Gaussian randomization scheme\nover both independent randomization and standard cross-validation, where the\nbias-variance tradeoff depends heavily on the number of folds."

In the present paper its exact value is\ndetermined for all groups of order less than $32$, for all finite groups with a\ncyclic subgroup of index at most $2$, and for the direct product of a dihedral\ngroup with the $2$-element group. The results show in particular that unlike\nthe ordinary Noether number, the separating Noether number of a non-abelian\nfinite group may well be equal to the separating Noether number of a proper\ndirect factor of the group.

    "abstract": "With potential applications to short-packet communication, we address\ncommunication of low-latency messages in fast-fading channels under the\npresence of a reactive jammer. Unlike a traditional jammer, we assume a\nfull-duplex (FD) jammer capable of detecting pre-existing countermeasures and\nsubsequently changing the target frequency band. To facilitate reliable\ncommunication amidst a strong adversary, we propose non-coherent fast-forward\nfull-duplex relaying scheme wherein the victim uses a helper in its vicinity to\nfast-forward its messages to the base station, in addition to ensuring that the\ncountermeasures are undetected by the FD adversary. Towards designing the\nconstellations for the proposed scheme, we identify that existing non-coherent\nconstellation for fast-fading channels are not applicable owing to the\ncooperative nature of the fast-forward scheme. As a result, we formulate an\noptimization problem of designing the non-coherent constellations at the victim\nand the helper such that the symbol-error-probability at the base station is\nminimized. We theoretically analyze the optimization problem and propose\nseveral strategies to compute near-optimal constellations based on the helper's\ndata-rate and fast-forwarding abilities. We show that the proposed\nconstellations provide near-optimal error performance and help the victim evade\njamming. Finally, we also prove the scheme's efficacy in deceiving the\ncountermeasure detectors at the jammer."

    "abstract": "Consider a set of agents collaboratively solving a distributed convex\noptimization problem, asynchronously, under stringent communication\nconstraints. In such situations, when an agent is activated and is allowed to\ncommunicate with only one of its neighbors, we would like to pick the one\nholding the most informative local estimate. We propose new algorithms where\nthe agents with maximal dissent average their estimates, leading to an\ninformation mixing mechanism that often displays faster convergence to an\noptimal solution compared to randomized gossip. The core idea is that when two\nneighboring agents whose distance between local estimates is the largest among\nall neighboring agents in the network average their states, it leads to the\nlargest possible immediate reduction of the quadratic Lyapunov function used to\nestablish convergence to the set of optimal solutions. As a broader\ncontribution, we prove the convergence of max-dissent subgradient methods using\na unified framework that can be used for other state-dependent distributed\noptimization algorithms. Our proof technique bypasses the need of establishing\nthe information flow between any two agents within a time interval of uniform\nlength by intelligently studying convergence properties of the Lyapunov\nfunction used in our analysis."

    "abstract": "Two finite words are k-binomially equivalent if each subword (i.e.,\nsubsequence) of length at most k occurs the same number of times in both words.\nThe k-binomial complexity of an infinite word is a function that maps the\ninteger $n\\geq 0$ to the number of k-binomial equivalence classes represented\nby its factors of length n. The Thue--Morse (TM) word and its generalization to\nlarger alphabets are ubiquitous in mathematics due to their rich combinatorial\nproperties. This work addresses the k-binomial complexities of generalized TM\nwords. Prior research by Lejeune, Leroy, and Rigo determined the k-binomial\ncomplexities of the 2-letter TM word. For larger alphabets, work by L\\\"u, Chen,\nWen, and Wu determined the 2-binomial complexity for m-letter TM words, for\narbitrary m, but the exact behavior for $k\\geq 3$ remained unresolved. They\nconjectured that the k-binomial complexity function of the m-letter TM word is\neventually periodic with period $m^k$. We resolve the conjecture positively by\nderiving explicit formulae for the k-binomial complexity functions for any\ngeneralized TM word. We do this by characterizing k-binomial equivalence among\nfactors of generalized TM words. This comprehensive analysis not only solves\nthe open conjecture, but also develops tools such as abelian Rauzy graphs."

In this paper, we propose a new piggybacking\ncoding design which designs the piggyback function over some instances of both\n$(n,k)$ MDS code and $(n,k')$ MDS code, when $k\\geq k'$. We show that our new\npiggybacking design can significantly reduce the repair bandwidth for\nsingle-node failures.

We\nshow that our code can significantly reduce repair bandwidth for single-node\nfailures at a cost of slightly more storage overhead.

Given a branched covering $f$ mimicking such post-singular behaviour,\none wants to decide whether it is Thurston equivalent to an entire function.\nThe answer is positive for a big class of entire function and generic escaping\nsingular orbits.\n  As in the Thurston's theorem, the problem reduces to the study of the\npull-back map $\\sigma$ defined on the corresponding Teichm\\\"uller space. But,\nunlike in the rational case, the space is infinite-dimensional and the\nbranching structure near $\\infty$ (which is essential singularity) is much more\nsubtle depending on the family of functions under consideration.

The Thue--Morse (TM) word and its generalization to\nlarger alphabets are ubiquitous in mathematics due to their rich combinatorial\nproperties. This work addresses the k-binomial complexities of generalized TM\nwords. Prior research by Lejeune, Leroy, and Rigo determined the k-binomial\ncomplexities of the 2-letter TM word. For larger alphabets, work by L\\\"u, Chen,\nWen, and Wu determined the 2-binomial complexity for m-letter TM words, for\narbitrary m, but the exact behavior for $k\\geq 3$ remained unresolved. They\nconjectured that the k-binomial complexity function of the m-letter TM word is\neventually periodic with period $m^k$. We resolve the conjecture positively by\nderiving explicit formulae for the k-binomial complexity functions for any\ngeneralized TM word. We do this by characterizing k-binomial equivalence among\nfactors of generalized TM words. This comprehensive analysis not only solves\nthe open conjecture, but also develops tools such as abelian Rauzy graphs."

In some cases it is required to\nrepresent such a vector with only $b$ bits per entry. A natural choice is to\npartition the interval $[0,1]$ into $2^b$ uniform bins and quantize entries to\neach bin independently. We show that a minor modification of this procedure --\napplying an entrywise non-linear function (compander) $f(x)$ prior to\nquantization -- yields an extremely effective quantization method. For example,\nfor $b=8 (16)$ and $10^5$-sized alphabets, the quality of representation\nimproves from a loss (under KL divergence) of $0.5 (0.1)$ bits/entry to\n$10^{-4} (10^{-9})$ bits/entry. Compared to floating point representations, our\ncompander method improves the loss from $10^{-1}(10^{-6})$ to\n$10^{-4}(10^{-9})$ bits/entry. These numbers hold for both real-world data\n(word frequencies in books and DNA $k$-mer counts) and for synthetic randomly\ngenerated distributions. Theoretically, we set up a minimax optimality\ncriterion and show that the compander $f(x) ~\\propto~\n\\mathrm{ArcSinh}(\\sqrt{(1/2) (K \\log K) x})$ achieves near-optimal performance,\nattaining a KL-quantization loss of $\\asymp 2^{-2b} \\log^2 K$ for a $K$-letter\nalphabet and $b\\to \\infty$.

Specialising to the case of Dyson Brownian\nmotion from the identity on $U(N)$ allows the moments of the spectral density,\nand the spectral form factor $S_N(k;t)$, to be evaluated explicitly in terms of\na certain hypergeometric polynomial.

A large body of the literature is devoted to finding such\nsolutions explicitly for various six-tuples $(a,b,c,p,q,r)$, as well as for\ninfinite families of such six-tuples. This paper surveys the families of\nparameters for which GFE has been solved. Although the proofs are not discussed\nhere, collecting these references in one place will make it easier for the\nreaders to find the relevant proof techniques in the original papers. Also,\nthis survey will help the readers to avoid duplicate work by solving the\nalready solved cases."

In the cycle convexity, we say\nthat $S$ is \\textit{cycle convex} if for any $u\\in V(G)\\setminus S$, the\ninduced subgraph of $S\\cup\\{u\\}$ contains no cycle that includes $u$. The\n\\textit{cycle convex hull} of $S$ is the smallest convex set containing $S$.\nThe \\textit{cycle hull number} of $G$, denoted by $hn_{cc}(G)$, is the\ncardinality of the smallest set $S$ such that the convex hull of $S$ is $V(G)$.\nThe \\textit{convexity number} of $G$, denoted by $C_{cc}(G)$, is the maximum\ncardinality of a proper convex set of $V(G)$. This paper studies cycle\nconvexity in graph products. We show that the cycle hull number is always two\nfor strong and lexicographic products. For the Cartesian, we establish tight\nbounds for this product and provide a closed formula when the factors are\ntrees, generalizing an existing result for grid graphs. In addition, given a\ngraph $G$ and an integer $k$, we prove that $hn_{cc}(G) \\leq k$ is NP-complete\neven if $G$ is a bipartite Cartesian product graph, addressing an open question\nin the literature. Furthermore, we present exact formulas for the cycle\nconvexity number in those three graph products.

To provide\nfurther insights, asymptotic analyses are performed for the MSR and MRP, which\nreveals that i) for the MSR, the optimal current distribution simplifies to\nmaximal ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming in the low-SNR regime and to\nzero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in the high-SNR regime; i) for the MRP, the\noptimal current distribution simplifies to ZF beamforming in the high-SNR\nregime.

The rate and\npower scaling laws are further analyzed by assuming an infinitely large CAPA.\nNumerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed secure continuous\nbeamforming design outperforms MRT and ZF beamforming in terms of both\nachievable secrecy rate and power efficiency; ii) CAPAs achieve superior\nsecrecy performance compared to conventional SPDAs."

We give evidence that the weight seems to organize the\nstructure of a Riemann function in a simpler way: first, a Riemann function $f$\nsatisfies a Riemann-Roch formula iff its weight satisfies a simpler symmetry\ncondition. Second, we will calculate the weight of the Baker-Norine rank for\ncertain graphs and show that the weight function is quite simple to describe;\nwe do this for graphs on two vertices and for the complete graph.\n  For the complete graph, we build on the work of Cori and Le Borgne who gave a\nlinear time method to compute the Baker-Norine rank of the complete graph. The\nassociated weight function has a simple formula and is extremely sparse (i.e.,\nmostly zero). Our computation of the weight function leads to another linear\ntime algorithm to compute the Baker-Norine rank, via a formula likely related\nto one of Cori and Le Borgne, but seemingly simpler, namely $$ r_{{\\rm\nBN},K_n}({\\bf d}) = -1+\\biggl| \\biggl\\{ i=0,\\ldots,{\\rm deg}({\\bf d}) \\ \\Bigm|\n\\ \\sum_{j=1}^{n-2} \\bigl( (d_j-d_{n-1}+i) \\bmod n \\bigr) \\le {\\rm deg}({\\bf\nd})-i \\biggr\\} \\biggr|. $$\n  Our study of weight functions leads to a natural generalization of Riemann\nfunctions, with many of the same properties exhibited by Riemann functions."

Using the theory of Markov chains of random\nwalks and the interchange process, it was proved that the algebraic\nconnectivities (second smallest Laplacian eigenvalues) of $G$ and $F_k(G)$\ncoincide, but a combinatorial/algebraic proof has been shown elusive. In this\npaper, we use the latter approach and prove that such equality holds for\ndifferent new classes of graphs under perturbations, such as extended cycles,\nextended complete bipartite graphs, kite graphs, and graphs with a cut clique.\nKite graphs are formed by a graph (head) with several paths (tail) rooted at\nthe same vertex and with exciting properties. For instance, we show that the\ndifferent eigenvalues of a kite graph are also eigenvalues of its perturbed\ngraph obtained by adding edges. Moreover, as a particular case of one of our\ntheorems, we generalize a recent result of Barik and Verma \\cite{bv24} about\ngraphs with a cut vertex of degree $n-1$. Along the way, we give conditions\nunder which the perturbed graph $G+uv$, with $uv\\in E$, has the same algebraic\nconnectivity as $G$."

Then $G \\in \\{\\mathsf{S}_{3},\\mathsf{D}_{10},\\mathsf{D}_{14},\\mathsf{D}_{18}\\}$.\n\\begin{proof}\n Assume for the moment that $G'$ is a $p$-group. We note  that $F(G)=G'$. Therefore, $G'/\\Phi(G)=F(G)/\\Phi(G)$ is $p$-elementary abelian. Thus, by Lemma \\ref{casopelem}, we have that $G/\\Phi(G) \\in \\{\\mathsf{S}_{3},\\mathsf{D}_{10},\\mathsf{D}_{14}\\}$ and hence $G'/\\Phi(G)$ is cyclic. Therefore, $G'$ is a cyclic $p$-group and and we have only three possibilities for $p$. We  analyse the cases $p=3$, $p=5$ and $p=7$ separately.\n\nIf $p=3$, then  $G'$ is a cyclic group of order $3^{l}$. If $l \\geq 3$, then there exists $K$ characteristic in $G'$  of order $3^{l-3}$. Thus, $|G/K|=2\\cdot3^{3}=54$ and $f(G/K)\\leq 3$. However, by Lemma \\ref{casos}, there is no group of order $54$ with $f(G)\\leq 3$. Thus, $l\\in\\{1,2\\}$. If $l=1$, then $G=\\mathsf{S}_{3}$ and if $l=2$, then  $G=\\mathsf{D}_{18}$.\n\n If $p \\in \\{5,7\\}$, then $G'$ is a cyclic group of order $p^{l}$. If $l \\geq 2$, then there exists $K$ characteristic in $G'$  of order $p^{l-2}$. Thus, $|G/K|=2\\cdot p^{2}$ and $f(G/K)\\leq 3$. For $p=5$, we have that $|G/K|=2\\cdot 5^{2}=50$ and for $p=7$, we have  that $|G/K|=2\\cdot 7^{2}=98$. However, by Lemma \\ref{casos}, there is no group of order $50$ or $98$ with $f(G)\\leq3$.\n\nTherefore, if $G'$ is a $p$-group, then $G \\in \\{\\mathsf{S}_{3},\\mathsf{D}_{18},\\mathsf{D}_{10},\\mathsf{D}_{14}\\}$. From here, we also deduce that  the prime divisors of $|G'|$ are contained in $\\{3,5,7\\}$. To complete the classification it only remains to prove that $|G'|$ cannot be divided by two different primes. Suppose that both $3$ and $5$ divide $|G'|$. Taking  a quotient by a Sylow $7$-subgroup of $G'$, we may assume that the only prime divisors of $|G'|$ are $3$ and $5$. By the case when $|G'|$ is a $p$-group, we deduce that the Sylow $3$-subgroups and Sylow $5$-subgroups of $G'$ are both cyclic. Thus, $f(G/\\Phi(G))\\leq 3$  and $G'/\\Phi(G)=\\mathsf{C}_{3}\\times \\mathsf{C}_{5}$. Therefore, $G/\\Phi(G)$ is a group of order $30$ with $f(G/\\Phi(G))\\leq 3$, which is impossible by Lemma \\ref{casos}. Analogously, we can prove that if any of the pairs $\\{3,7\\}$ or $\\{5,7\\}$ divides $|G'|$ at the same time, then there exists  a group $H$ with $f(H)\\leq 3$ of order $42$ or $70$, respectively. Applying again Lemma \\ref{casos}, we have a contradiction. Thus, $G'$ is a $p$-group and the result follows.\n\\end{proof}",

    "abstract": "Shallow permutations were defined in 1977 to be those that satisfy the lower\nbound of the Diaconis-Graham inequality. Recently, there has been renewed\ninterest in these permutations. In particular, Berman and Tenner showed they\nsatisfy certain pattern avoidance conditions in their cycle form and Woo showed\nthey are exactly those whose cycle diagrams are unlinked. Shallow permutations\nthat avoid 321 have appeared in many contexts; they are those permutations for\nwhich depth equals the reflection length, they have unimodal cycles, and they\nhave been called Boolean permutations. Motivated by this interest in\n321-avoiding shallow permutations, we investigate $\\sigma$-avoiding shallow\npermutations for all $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{S}_3$. To do this, we develop more\ngeneral structural results about shallow permutations, and apply them to\nenumerate shallow permutations avoiding any pattern of length 3."

Given such a map $H:\\mathbb{Z}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}$, one can\nconstruct a function $\\chi_{H}:\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_{q}$ for an\nappropriate choice of distinct primes $p,q$ with the property that\n$x\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash\\left\\{ 0\\right\\} $ is a periodic point of $H$ if and\nonly if there is a $p$-adic integer\n$\\mathfrak{z}\\in\\left(\\mathbb{Q}\\cap\\mathbb{Z}_{p}\\right)\\backslash\\left\\{\n0,1,2,\\ldots\\right\\} $ so that $\\chi_{H}\\left(\\mathfrak{z}\\right)=x$. By\ngeneralizing Monna-Springer integration theory and establishing a\n$\\left(p,q\\right)$-adic analogue of the Wiener Tauberian Theorem, one can show\nthat the question 'is $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\backslash\\left\\{ 0\\right\\} $ a periodic\npoint of $H$?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of\nthe Fourier transform of $\\chi_{H}\\left(\\mathfrak{z}\\right)-x$ dense in an\nappropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new\nfrontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study\nCollatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ for any\n$d\\geq1$."

On this basis, the fundamental secrecy\nperformance limits achieved by CAPAs are analyzed by deriving closed-form\nexpressions for the maximum secrecy rate (MSR) and minimum required power\n(MRP), along with the corresponding optimal current distributions. To provide\nfurther insights, asymptotic analyses are performed for the MSR and MRP, which\nreveals that i) for the MSR, the optimal current distribution simplifies to\nmaximal ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming in the low-SNR regime and to\nzero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in the high-SNR regime; i) for the MRP, the\noptimal current distribution simplifies to ZF beamforming in the high-SNR\nregime. The derived results are specialized to the typical array structures,\ne.g., planar CAPAs and planar spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). The rate and\npower scaling laws are further analyzed by assuming an infinitely large CAPA.\nNumerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed secure continuous\nbeamforming design outperforms MRT and ZF beamforming in terms of both\nachievable secrecy rate and power efficiency; ii) CAPAs achieve superior\nsecrecy performance compared to conventional SPDAs."

The distance to the border is dual, in\na certain sense, to the height. The first of these distances is the minimum of\nthe distances from the root to the leaves. The second is the maximum of the\ndistances from the root to the leaves. These are two extreme complementary\ncases."

    "abstract": "Shallow permutations were defined in 1977 to be those that satisfy the lower\nbound of the Diaconis-Graham inequality. Recently, there has been renewed\ninterest in these permutations. In particular, Berman and Tenner showed they\nsatisfy certain pattern avoidance conditions in their cycle form and Woo showed\nthey are exactly those whose cycle diagrams are unlinked. Shallow permutations\nthat avoid 321 have appeared in many contexts; they are those permutations for\nwhich depth equals the reflection length, they have unimodal cycles, and they\nhave been called Boolean permutations. Motivated by this interest in\n321-avoiding shallow permutations, we investigate $\\sigma$-avoiding shallow\npermutations for all $\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{S}_3$. To do this, we develop more\ngeneral structural results about shallow permutations, and apply them to\nenumerate shallow permutations avoiding any pattern of length 3."

In this paper, we propose a new piggybacking\ncoding design which designs the piggyback function over some instances of both\n$(n,k)$ MDS code and $(n,k')$ MDS code, when $k\\geq k'$. We show that our new\npiggybacking design can significantly reduce the repair bandwidth for\nsingle-node failures. When $k=k'$, we design piggybacking code that is MDS code\nand we show that the designed code has lower repair bandwidth for single-node\nfailures than all existing piggybacking codes when the number of parity node\n$r=n-k\\geq8$ and the sub-packetization $\\alpha<r$.\n  Moreover, we propose another piggybacking codes by designing $n$ piggyback\nfunctions of some instances of $(n,k)$ MDS code and adding the $n$ piggyback\nfunctions into the $n$ newly created empty entries with no data symbols. We\nshow that our code can significantly reduce repair bandwidth for single-node\nfailures at a cost of slightly more storage overhead. In addition, we show that\nour code can recover any $r+1$ node failures for some parameters. We also show\nthat our code has lower repair bandwidth than locally repairable codes (LRCs)\nunder the same fault-tolerance and redundancy for some parameters."
