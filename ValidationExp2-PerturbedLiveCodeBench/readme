1. From the repository root, set up the unified environment:

```powershell
uv sync
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Set up your API key:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-actual-api-key-here"
```

3. cd to this folder and run the code:

```powershell
python livecodebench.py
python analysis.py
python plotting.py
```

Remark: livecodebench-final.ipynb is the same as the python code, and livecodebench-analysis.ipynb contains older code that is not used in the final version, but for exploratory purposes.
