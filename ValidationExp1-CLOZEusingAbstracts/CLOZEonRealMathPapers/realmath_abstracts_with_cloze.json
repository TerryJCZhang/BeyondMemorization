We compute limiting distributions (with respect to some common utility functions) as n→∞ of both the [blank3] and the [blank4]. To do this, we compute limiting distributions of the outcomes for an arbitrary agent whose initial relative position in the tiebreak order is θ∈[0,1], as a function of θ. The results for the [blank2] algorithms are all new, and we expect that these fundamental results on the stochastic processes underlying these algorithms will have wider applicability in future. Overall our results show that the differences in [blank3] performance of the three algorithms are fairly small but still important. However, the differences in [blank4] are much greater.

In some cases it is required to\nrepresent such a vector with only $b$ bits per entry. A natural choice is to\npartition the interval $[0,1]$ into $2^b$ uniform bins and quantize entries to\neach bin independently. We show that a minor modification of this procedure --\napplying an entrywise non-linear function (compander) $f(x)$ prior to\nquantization -- yields an extremely effective quantization method. For example,\nfor $b=8 (16)$ and $10^5$-sized alphabets, the quality of representation\nimproves from a loss (under KL divergence) of $0.5 (0.1)$ bits/entry to\n$10^{-4} (10^{-9})$ bits/entry. Compared to floating point representations, our\ncompander method improves the loss from $10^{-1}(10^{-6})$ to\n$10^{-4}(10^{-9})$ bits/entry. These numbers hold for both real-world data\n(word frequencies in books and DNA $k$-mer counts) and for synthetic randomly\ngenerated distributions. Theoretically, we set up a minimax optimality\ncriterion and show that the compander $f(x) ~\\propto~\n\\mathrm{ArcSinh}(\\sqrt{(1/2) (K \\log K) x})$ achieves near-optimal performance,\nattaining a KL-quantization loss of $\\asymp 2^{-2b} \\log^2 K$ for a $K$-letter\nalphabet and $b\\to \\infty$. Interestingly, a similar minimax criterion for the\nquadratic loss on the hypercube shows optimality of the standard uniform\nquantizer.

We show that a minor modification of this procedure -- applying an [blank3] prior to quantization -- yields an extremely effective quantization method. For example, for b=8 (16) and 10^5-sized alphabets, the quality of representation improves from a loss (under [blank4]) of 0.5 (0.1) bits/entry to 10^{-4} (10^{-9}) bits/entry. Theoretically, we set up a minimax optimality criterion and show that the compander f(x) proportional to ArcSinh achieves near-optimal performance, suggesting that the [blank5] is as fundamental for KL-distortion as the uniform quantizer for quadratic distortion.",

By adding $1$ to the Baker-Norine rank\nfunction of a graph, one gets an equivalent Riemann function, and similarly for\nrelated rank functions.\n  To each Riemann function we associate a related function $W\\colon{\\mathbb\nZ}^n\\to{\\mathbb Z}$ via M\\\"obius inversion that we call the {\\em weight} of the\nRiemann function. We give evidence that the weight seems to organize the\nstructure of a Riemann function in a simpler way: first, a Riemann function $f$\nsatisfies a Riemann-Roch formula iff its weight satisfies a simpler symmetry\ncondition. Second, we will calculate the weight of the Baker-Norine rank for\ncertain graphs and show that the weight function is quite simple to describe;\nwe do this for graphs on two vertices and for the complete graph.\n  For the complete graph, we build on the work of Cori and Le Borgne who gave a\nlinear time method to compute the Baker-Norine rank of the complete graph. The\nassociated weight function has a simple formula and is extremely sparse (i.e.,\nmostly zero).

We propose a new approach for studying these complexity trade-offs by considering a related algebraic framework. Specifically, given a single linear equation with arbitrary coefficients, we would like to express it using a system of linear equations with smaller (even constant) coefficients. The techniques we developed are based on [blank2] for the bounds, [blank3] for the existential results and extensions of [blank4] for the constructions.\n  We explicitly construct a constant weight, optimal size matrix to compute the [blank5] (checking if two integers expressed in binary are equal). Computing EQUALITY with a single linear equation requires exponentially large weights. In addition, we prove the existence of the best-known weight size (linear) matrices to compute the COMPARISON function (comparing between two integers expressed in binary). In the context of the circuit complexity theory, our results improve the upper bounds on the weight sizes for the best-known circuit sizes for EQUALITY and COMPARISON.",

    "cloze_question": "What use can there be for a function from the [blank1], where p and q are distinct primes? The traditional answer, courtesy of the half-century old theory of [blank2]: not much. It turns out this judgment was premature. '[blank3]' of this sort appears to be naturally suited for studying the infamous Collatz map and similar arithmetical dynamical systems. Given such a map H: Z→Z, one can construct a function χ_H: Z_p→Z_q for an appropriate choice of distinct primes p,q with the property that x∈Z\\{0} is a periodic point of H if and only if there is a [blank4] so that χ_H(𝔷)=x. By generalizing [blank5], one can show that the question 'is x∈Z\\{0} a periodic point of H?' is essentially equivalent to 'is the span of the translates of the Fourier transform of χ_H(𝔷)-x dense in an appropriate non-archimedean function space?' This presents an exciting new frontier in Collatz research, and these methods can be used to study Collatz-type dynamical systems on the lattice Z^d for any d≥1.",

For positive parameters \\lambda the [blank2] is defined an injective for functions f\\in L^2(N) and we give a novel characterization of [blank2](L^2(N)) in terms of complex analysis. For that we view eigenfunctions \\phi = [blank2](f) as families (\\phi_a)_{a\\in A} of functions on the N-orbits, i.e. \\phi_a(n)= \\phi(na) for n\\in N. The general theory then tells us that there is a [blank4] T\\subset N_\\mathbb{C} such that each \\phi_a extends to a holomorphic function on the scaled tube T_a=N\\exp(i\\operatorname{Ad}(a)\\Lambda). We define a class of N-invariant weight functions {\\bf w}_\\lambda on the tube T, rescale them for every a\\in A to a weight {\\bf w}_{\\lambda, a} on T_a, and show that each \\phi_a lies in the [blank5] \\mathcal{B}(T_a, {\\bf w}_{\\lambda, a}):=\\mathcal{O}(T_a)\\cap L^2(T_a, {\\bf w}_{\\lambda, a}). The main result of the article then describes [blank2](L^2(N)) as those eigenfunctions \\phi for which \\phi_a\\in \\mathcal{B}(T_a, {\\bf w}_{\\lambda, a}) and ||\\phi||:=\\sup_{a\\in A} a^{\\operatorname{Re}\\lambda -2\\rho} ||\\phi_a||_{\\mathcal{B}_{a,\\lambda}}<\\infty holds.",
