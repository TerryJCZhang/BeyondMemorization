The [blank2] consists of finding the number of vertices in a largest [blank1] set of G, whilst the [blank3] asks for a smallest maximal [blank1] set. In this paper we determine the lower general position numbers of several families of [blank4]. We also show that the existence of small maximal general position sets in a Cartesian product is connected to a special type of general position set in the factors, which we call a [blank5], for which adding any vertex u from outside the set creates three vertices in a line with u as an endpoint. We give a constructive proof of the existence of [blank5] for graphs with diameter at most three. We also present conjectures on the existence of [blank5] for all graphs and a lower bound on the lower general position number of a Cartesian product in terms of the lower general position numbers of its factors.",

To address this problem, Masařík and Hliněný [GD 2023] recently asked for each edge of G to be drawn without crossings while allowing multiple different drawings of G. More formally, a collection~\\mathcal{D} of drawings of G is [blank1] if, for each edge e of G, there is a drawing in \\mathcal{D} in which e is uncrossed. The [blank2] \\Ucr(G) of G is then the minimum number of drawings in some [blank1] collection of G.\n\nNo exact values of the [blank2] have been determined yet, not even for simple graph classes. In this paper, we provide the exact values for uncrossed numbers of [blank3], partly confirming and partly refuting a conjecture posed by Hliněný and Masařík [GD 2023]. We also present a [blank4] on \\Ucr(G) in terms of the [blank4]. Moreover, we prove [blank5] of the related problem of determining the edge crossing number of a graph G, which is the smallest number of edges of G taken over all drawings of G that participate in a crossing.

The core of this theorem is an unexpected relation between the number of points on the K3 surface and that on a CM elliptic curve.",

    "cloze_question": "We consider testing a composite null hypothesis \\mathcal{P} against a point alternative \\mathsf{Q} using [blank1], which are nonnegative random variables X such that \\mathbb{E}_\\mathsf{P}[X] \\leq 1 for every \\mathsf{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}. This paper establishes a fundamental result: under no conditions whatsoever on \\mathcal{P} or \\mathsf{Q}, there exists a special e-variable X^* that we call the [blank2], which is strictly positive and satisfies \\mathbb{E}_\\mathsf{Q}[X/X^*] \\leq 1 for every other e-variable X. In particular, X^* is log-optimal in the sense that \\mathbb{E}_\\mathsf{Q}[\\log(X/X^*)] \\leq 0. Moreover, X^* identifies a particular [blank3] \\mathsf{P}^* via the density d \\mathsf{P}^*/d \\mathsf{Q} = 1/X^*. As a result, X^* can be seen as a generalized likelihood ratio of \\mathsf{Q} against \\mathcal{P}. We show that \\mathsf{P}^* coincides with the [blank4] when additional assumptions are made that are required for the latter to exist. Thus \\mathsf{P}^* is a natural definition of the RIPr in the absence of any assumptions on \\mathcal{P} or \\mathsf{Q}. In addition to the abstract theory, we provide several tools for finding the numeraire and RIPr in concrete cases. We discuss several nonparametric examples where we can indeed identify the numeraire and RIPr, despite not having a reference measure. Our results have interpretations outside of testing in that they yield the optimal [blank5] against \\mathcal{P} if we believe reality follows \\mathsf{Q}. We end with a more general optimality theory that goes beyond the ubiquitous logarithmic utility. We focus on certain power utilities, leading to reverse Rényi projections in place of the RIPr, which also always exist.",

We attempt to imitate the idea of the Lyusternik region by defining a region based on the [blank3], which was originally defined by Rolf Schneider in 1975. We call this region the [blank4], denoted by S_n(m). In this paper, we will give an initial characterization of the region S_1(2) and in doing so, we will prove that the Schneider non-convexity index of a sumset c(A_1+A_2) has a best lower bound in terms of c(A_1) and c(A_2). We will pose some open questions about extending this lower bound to higher dimensions and large sums. We will also show that, analogous to Lebesgue measure, the Schneider non-convexity index has a fractional subadditive property.

Such curves are said to be discriminant twins if, for each prime p of K, there are p-minimal models for E1 and E2 whose discriminants are equal. This article explicitly classifies all prime-isogenous discriminant (ideal) twins over Q. We obtain this classification as a consequence of our main results, which constructively gives all p-isogenous discriminant ideal twins over number fields where p in [blank3], i.e., where X_0(p) has [blank4]. In particular, we find that up to twist, there are finitely many p-isogenous discriminant ideal twins if and only if K is Q or an [blank5]. In the latter case, we provide instructions for finding the finitely many pairs of j-invariants that result in p-isogenous discriminant ideal twins. We prove our results by considering the [blank6] of parameterized p-isogenous elliptic curves.",

Our ultimate aim is to determine the multiplicities of the irreducible representations in this representation. This had been done for the ordinary [blank3] by Kraskiewicz and Weyman. The $k=2$ case was handled in our prior work, where the representation was shown to be isomorphic to S^{2^{n-1}1}. In this paper, for general $n$ and $k$, we obtain decomposition results that enable us to determine the multiplicities in the $k=3$ and $k=4$ cases. In particular we prove that in the $k=3$ case, the representation is isomorphic to a [blank4]. Our main result shows that the multiplicities stabilize in a certain sense when $n$ exceeds $k$.

    "cloze_question": "In this work, [blank1] modulo powers of primes p ≥ 5 are derived for a general class of products that are modular forms of level p. These products are constructed in terms of [blank2] and subsume generating functions for [blank3] known to satisfy [blank1] for p=5,7,11. The vectors of exponents corresponding to products that are modular forms for Γ1(p) are subsets of [blank4] with explicit parameterizations. This allows for the derivation of a complete list of products that are modular forms for Γ1(p) of weights 1≤k≤5 for primes 5≤p≤19 and whose Fourier coefficients satisfy [blank1] for all powers of the primes. For each product satisfying a congruence, cyclic permutations of the exponents determine additional products satisfying congruences. Common forms among the exponent sets lead to products satisfying [blank1] for a broad class of primes, including p>19. Canonical bases for modular forms of level 5≤p≤19 are constructed by summing weight one [blank5] of levels 5≤p≤19 and expressing the result as a quotient of [blank2]. Generating sets for the graded algebras of modular forms for Γ1(p) and Γ(p) are formulated in terms of permutations of the exponent sets. A sieving process is described by decomposing the space of modular forms of weight 1 for Γ1(p) as a direct sum of subspaces of modular forms for Γ(p) of the form q^{r/p}Z[[q]]. Since the relevant bases generate the graded algebra of modular forms for these groups, the weight one decompositions determine series dissections for modular forms of higher weight that lead to additional classes of congruences.",

The regularity estimates that we obtain are quantitative and constructive (all computable constants), and have a local character, allowing us to show further properties of the solutions: for instance, initial singularities do not move with time. We also study the asymptotic behavior for large times of solutions to Dirichlet and Neumann problems. Our results are new also in the linear case and are sharp when p is integer.

    "before_cutoff": true,
    "cloze_question": "Decentralized stochastic control problems with local information involve problems where multiple agents and subsystems which are coupled via dynamics and/or cost are present. Typically, however, the dynamics of such couplings is complex and difficult to precisely model, leading to questions on robustness in control design. Additionally, when such a coupling can be modeled, the problem arrived at is typically challenging and non-convex, due to [blank1] information. In this paper, we develop a robustness framework for optimal [blank2] of interacting agents, where we show that a decentralized control problem with interacting agents can be robustly designed by considering a [blank3] of non-interacting agents/particles. This leads to a tractable robust formulation where we give a bound on the value of the cost function in terms of the risk-sensitive cost function for the non-interacting case plus a term involving the \"strength\" of the interaction as measured by [blank4]. We will build on Gaussian measure theory and an associated variational equality. A particular application includes [blank5] consisting of a generally large number of interacting agents which are often hard to solve for the case with small or moderate numbers of agents, leading to an interest in effective approximations and robustness. By adapting a risk-sensitivity parameter, we also robustly control a non-symmetrically interacting problem with mean-field cost by one which is symmetric with a risk-sensitive criterion, and in the limit of small interactions, show the stability of optimal solutions to perturbations.",

For this we introduce [blank3]. They generalize Steinberg quiver flag varieties in a non-obvious way, reflecting the diagrammatics from the Naisse--Vaz construction. Using different kind of stratifications we provide geometric explanations of the rather mysterious algebraic and diagrammatic basis theorems.\n\nA geometric categorification of Verma modules was recently found in the special case of [blank4] by Rouquier. Rouquier's construction uses coherent sheaves on certain quasi-map spaces to flag varieties (zastavas), whereas our construction is implicitly based on [blank5]. Both should be seen as parts (on dual sides) of a general geometric framework for the Naisse--Vaz approach.\n\nWe first treat the (substantially easier) [blank4] case in detail and construct as a byproduct a geometric dg-model of the [blank2] . The extra difficulties we encounter in general require the use of more complicated [blank3]. Their definition arises from combinatorially defined diagram varieties which we assign to each Naisse--Vaz basis diagram. Our explicit analysis here might shed some light on categories of coherent sheaves on more general zastava spaces studied by Feigin--Finkelberg--Kuznetsov--Mirkovi{\\'c} and Braverman, which we expect to occur in a generalization of Rouquier's construction away from [blank4].",

Molnár, \\textit{Characterizations of certain means of positive operators}, Linear Algebra Appl. 567 (2019) 143-166, where he gives a characterization of this subclass (which we call the [blank1]) in terms of the properties of their representing operator monotone functions. Molnár's paper leaves open the problem of determining if the [blank2] is the only such mean in that subclass. Here we give a negative answer to this question by constructing an [blank3] between this class and a class of [blank4] bounded in absolute value by 1/2. Each member of the latter class defines a Molnár mean by an explicit [blank5]. From this we are able to understand the order structure of the Molnár class and construct several infinite families of explicit examples of Molnár means that are not the [blank2].

We establish bounds on the mixing time of the FEP on the segment, with closed boundaries, and the circle. The FEP on these spaces exhibits transient states that, if the macroscopic density of particles is at least 1/2, the process will eventually exit to reach an ergodic component. If the macroscopic density is less than 1/2 the process will hit an absorbing state. We show that the symmetric FEP (SFEP) on the segment {1,...,N}, with k>N/2 particles, has mixing time of [blank2] and exhibits the [blank3]. For the asymmetric FEP (AFEP) on the segment, we show that there exists initial conditions for which the hitting time of the ergodic component is [blank4] in the number of holes N-k. In particular, when N-k is large enough, the hitting time of the ergodic component determines the mixing time. For the SFEP on the circle of size N, and macroscopic particle density rho in (1/2,1), we establish bounds on the mixing time of order N^2 log N for the process restricted to its ergodic component. We also give an upper bound on the hitting time of the ergodic component of order N^2 log N for a large class of initial conditions.

We show that the density with respect to any given [blank2] on a shift space exists for every group language, because it can be computed by using any ergodic lift of the given measure to some [blank3] between the shift space and the recognizing group. We then further study densities in shifts of finite type (with a suitable notion of irreducibility), and then in minimal shifts. In the latter case, we obtain a closed formula for the density under the condition that the [blank4] of the [blank3] are ergodic under the product of the original measure and the [blank5] on the group. The formula is derived in part from a characterization of [blank4] for [blank3] relying on notions of cocycles and coboundaries. In the case where the whole [blank3] is ergodic under the product measure, then the density is just the cardinality of the subset of the group which defines the language divided by the cardinality of the group. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions for the [blank3] to have [blank4] that are ergodic under the product measure.

We use [blank4] to numerically approximate chemotaxis-driven spatial patterns and explore the effectiveness of the [blank5] to reconstruct them. Our findings show that pDMD is effective at precisely recreating chemotaxis-driven spatial patterns, therefore broadening the range of application of the method to classes of solutions different than Turing patterns.

Fundamental to our approach is the use of ideas from logic, particularly a careful analysis of the quantifier structure of probabilistic statements and the introduction of a number of abstract notions that represent stochastic convergence in a quantitative manner. In this sense, our work falls under the `proof mining' program, and indeed, our quantitative results provide new examples of the phenomenon, recently made precise by the first author and Pischke, that many proofs in probability theory are proof-theoretically tame, and amenable to the extraction of quantitative data that is both of low complexity and independent of the underlying probability space.",

    "cloze_question": "The notion of [blank1] first arose as consequence of Hilbert's work on commutative algebra, relating the dimension of rings with the degree of certain polynomials. For noncommutative rings, the notion of multiplicity first appeared in the context of modules for the Weyl algebra in Bernstein's solution of the problem of analytic continuation posed by I. Gelfand. The notion was shown to be useful to many more noncommutative rings, especially enveloping algebras, rings of differential operators, and quantum groups. In all these cases, the existence of multiplicity is related to the existence of [blank2]. In this work we give an axiomatic definition of algebras with a notion of multiplicity, which we call [blank3]. We show, in an abstract setting, how the existence of Hilbert-Samuel polynomials implies the existence of a notion of multiplicity. We apply our results for the category of [blank4] — a notion which coincides with holonomic modules for simple algebras — and that shares many similarities with it. In particular, we generalize the usual results in the literature that are stated for Ore domains, in the more general context of prime algebras, and we show that [blank5] admit a notion of multiplicity.",

In other words, this model involves a collection of [blank4] evolving through graph-based interactions. We briefly investigate the first- and second-order asymptotic behaviour of the joint walks and establish connections with other network-based reinforced stochastic processes studied in the literature. We show that the joint walk can be expressed as a [blank5]. In certain regimes, we employ tools from stochastic approximation theory to derive the asymptotic properties of the joint walks. Additionally, in a specific regime, we use better techniques to establish a strong invariance principle and a central limit theorem with improved rates compared to existing results in the stochastic approximation literature. These techniques can also be used to strengthen equivalent results in stochastic approximation theory. As a byproduct, we establish a strong invariance principle for the simple elephant random walk with significantly improved rates.",

Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among [blank2]. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural [blank3], assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable. Variants of the existence theorem are also proved, first under the constraint that finite sets of landmark points in the two images are mapped one to the other, and second when one image is to be compared to an unknown part of another.\n\nThe question is studied as to whether for images related by an [blank4] the unique minimiser is given by that affine mapping. For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of affinely related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone. This suggests a new model in which the integrand depends also on [blank5], and an example is given for which both existence of minimisers is assured and the above property holds for all pairs of affinely related images.",

The framework captures model uncertainty, with potential models penalized in function of their [blank2] to a given reference model. Strength of the penalty is controlled using a real-valued [blank3], which, in the special case of an indicator penalty, is simply the radius of the uncertainty ball. Our main results derive the first-order sensitivity of the value of causal DRO with respect to the penalization parameter, i.e., we compute the sensitivity to model uncertainty. Moreover, we investigate the case where a [blank4] is imposed on the underlying model, as is the case for pricing measures in mathematical finance. We introduce different scaling regimes, which allow us to obtain the continuous-time sensitivities as nontrivial limits of their discrete-time counterparts. We illustrate our results with examples. The sensitivities are naturally expressed using [blank5]. To establish our results we obtain several novel results which are of independent interest. In particular, we introduce pathwise Malliavin derivatives and show these extend the classical notion. We also establish a novel stochastic Fubini theorem.",

We investigate the fundamental limits of computation for this problem by providing new necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for tractability. On the one hand, we obtain the first intractability results, in the best-case sense, for [blank2] with bounded rank, in terms of the [blank3]. Namely, first, under some mild assumptions, we show that for every sequence of hypergraphs indexed by the treewidth and with bounded rank, the complexity of solving the associated [blank1] problem grows super-polynomially in the treewidth. Second, we show that any hypergraph of bounded rank is the underlying hypergraph of some signed hypergraph for which the corresponding pseudo-Boolean polytope has an [blank4] in the treewidth. On the other hand, we introduce the nest-set gap, a new hypergraph-theoretic notion that enables us to define a notion of \"distance\" from the hypergaph acyclicity. We prove that if this distance is bounded, the pseudo-Boolean polytope admits a [blank5]. This in turn enables us to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for a large class of pseudo-Boolean optimization problems whose underlying hypergraphs contain β-cycles.",

To this end, we first construct [blank2] and examine their properties, including the asymptotic behavior at infinity, which determines the type of singularity. Using these profiles as a reference and employing [blank3], we establish [blank4] for the blow-up solutions in self-similar variables, thereby demonstrating the stability of the self-similar profiles we construct. Our results indicate that the solutions, evolving from smooth initial data within a fairly general open set, form [blank5] cusps as the first singularity in finite time. These singularities are analogous to pre-shocks emerging in the Burgers equation, exhibiting unbounded gradients while the solutions themselves remain bounded. However, the nature of the singularity differs from that of the Burgers equation, which is a cubic-root singularity. Our work provides the first proof that generic pre-shocks of the CH equation exhibit the stated Holder regularity. It is our construction of new self-similar profiles, incorporating the precise leading-order correction to the CH equation in the blow-up regime, that enables us to identify the sharp Holder regularity of the singularities and to capture the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of the blow-up. We also show that the generic singularities developed in the Hunter-Saxton equation are of the same type as those in the CH equation.",

This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain [blank4]. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.\n\nIn the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new [blank5]. While some applications are addressed using L^2-theory, many require a more general L^p(L^q)-framework.

Consider two draws of size $K$ taken with replacement from a set of $I$ objects, where the two draws represent samples from potentially distinct probability distributions over the set of $I$ objects. We define the set of [blank1] for pairs of draws via a series of actions by [blank2], describing the enumeration of all such states for a given $K \\geq 2$ and $I \\geq 2$. Given two probability vectors for the $I$ objects, we compute the [blank3]. From the set of all such probabilities, we obtain the [blank4], finding that it has a simple form that generalizes a result previously obtained for the case of $K=2$. We determine when the expected dissimilarity between two draws from the same probability distribution exceeds that of two draws taken from different probability distributions. We interpret the results in the setting of the [blank5], those whose genetic material contains many copies of the genome ($K > 2$).",

Motivated by [blank2], we propose studying [blank1] in [blank3], which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the underlying dynamics. Our first result demonstrates that a single [blank1] in [blank3] can be used to perform system identification up to a [blank4].

Continuing to explore the power of [blank3], we eliminate all ambiguity from the conjugacy relation by showing that [blank5] of [blank1] in [blank3] constructed from [blank5] can achieve unique system identification.

Moreover, $\\mathbb{V}^\\vee\\circ D^\\vee_\\Delta$ produces irreducible representations of $\\GQpD\\times \\Qp^\\times$ when applied to irreducible objects on the automorphic side and detects isomorphisms unless it vanishes. Further, we determine the kernel of $D^\\vee_\\Delta$ when restricted to successive extensions of subquotients of [blank5].

We assume that the population lives in a [blank2], so that a given phenotypic trait may be more or less fit according to the spatial location. The model features spatial mobility of individuals as well as mutation.\n\nWe first prove the well-posedness of the model. Next, we derive a criterion for the persistence of the population which involves the [blank3] associated with the linearised elliptic operator. This notion allows us to handle the possible lack of coercivity of the operator. We then obtain a [blank4], in terms of the frequency of spatial fluctuations of the environment and in terms of the spatial diffusivity. We deduce that the more heterogeneous is the environment, or the higher is the mobility of individuals, the harder is the persistence for the species.\n\nThis work lays the mathematical foundation to investigate some other [blank5] for the environment to make persistence as hard or as easy as possible, which will be addressed in the forthcoming companion paper.",

We show precise representation formulas and comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we call \"[blank4]\" (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian structures and established here for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the associated distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts formula. This treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric geometry expands upon its recent nonlinear yet elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth case, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut locus. Two central ingredients our contribution unifies are the localization paradigm of Cavalletti--Mondino and the Sobolev calculus of Beran--Braun--Calisti--Gigli--McCann--Ohanyan--Rott--S\"amann.\n\nIn the second part of our work, we present several applications of these insights. First, we show the equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension condition with a [blank5]. Second, we set up synthetic mean curvature (as well as barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove synthetic volume and area estimates of Heintze--Karcher-type, which enable us to show several synthetic volume singularity theorems.",

There are broadly two types of these companions: the [blank1] and the [blank2] variable inclusion companions. Another type of companions of logics induced by [blank3] were introduced in \\cite{BasuChakraborty2021}. A sufficient condition for the [blank4] of a Hilbert-style logic to coincide with its left variable inclusion companion was proved there, while a necessary condition remained elusive. The present article has two parts. In the first part, we give a [blank5] for the left variable inclusion and the restricted rules companions of a Hilbert-style logic to coincide. In the rest of the paper, we recognize that the variable inclusion restrictions used to define variable inclusion companions of a logic are relations from sets of formulas to formulas. This leads to a more general idea of a relational companion of a logical structure, a framework that we borrow from the field of universal logic. We end by showing that even Hilbert-style logics and the restricted rules companions of these can be brought under the umbrella of the general notions of logical structures and their relational companions that are discussed here.",

    "cloze_question": "In this work, we present a mathematical theory for [blank1] and interface modes in honeycomb topological photonic structures consisting of impenetrable obstacles. Starting from a honeycomb lattice of obstacles attaining 120°-rotation symmetry and horizontal reflection symmetry, we apply the [blank2] to show the existence of [blank1] for the first two bands at the vertices of the Brillouin zone. We then study interface modes in a joint honeycomb photonic structure, which consists of two periodic lattices obtained by perturbing the honeycomb one with [blank1] differently. The perturbations break the reflection symmetry of the system, as a result, they annihilate the [blank1] and generate two structures with different topological phases, which mimics the [blank3] in topological insulators. We investigate the interface modes that decay [blank4] away from the interface of the joint structure in several configurations with different interface geometries, including the [blank5], the armchair interface, and the rational interfaces. Using the [blank4] and asymptotic analysis, we first characterize the band-gap opening for the two perturbed periodic structures and derive the asymptotic expansions of the Bloch modes near the band gap surfaces. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for each joint honeycomb structure using boundary integral equations over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operators, we prove the existence of interface modes when the perturbation is small.",

The transformations are obtained for all relevant quantities, including the matrix potential, the Jost solution, the regular solution, the Jost matrix, the scattering matrix, and the boundary condition. For each bound state, the corresponding dependency matrix is introduced by connecting the normalization matrix used in the Gel'fand--Levitan method and the normalization matrix used in the [blank5]. Various estimates are provided to describe the large spacial asymptotics for the change in the potential when the bound states are removed or added or their multiplicities are modified.

This boundary is constructed out of [blank2] (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The [blank1] is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one [blank3] and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.

Intrigued by this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior.

This quantity extends to any [blank2] supported on a graph G with n vertices. The average nodal count, averaged over all eigenvectors of a given matrix, is known to be bounded between (n-1)/2 and (n-1)/2+[blank3], where [blank3] is the first Betti number of G (a topological quantity), and it was believed that generically the average should be around (n-1)/2+[blank3]/2.

For any connected graph G, a generic [blank2] supported on G satisfies this [blank4]. However, the situation for [blank5] is far more subtle. We completely characterize the graphs G for which this condition is generically true, and show that if this is not the case, then any [blank2] supported on G with [blank5] has a multiple eigenvalue or an eigenvector that vanishes somewhere.

In this article, we explicitly derive the Virasoro algebra from an axiomatization of the conformal anomaly in terms of [blank1], one-dimensional vector spaces associated to Riemann surfaces with analytically parametrized boundary components. Here, analytical orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms and deformations of the circle naturally act on the boundary components. We introduce a [blank2] on the real determinant lines over the semigroup of annuli, which then induces [blank3] of the diffeomorphism group, as well as of the complex deformations.\n\nOur main theorem shows that on the one hand, the cocycle associated to the central extension of diffeomorphisms is trivial, while on the other hand, the Lie algebra cocycle associated to the central extension of complex deformations is nontrivial, yielding the imaginary part of the [blank4]. We thus answer a question, partly negatively and partly affirmatively, discussed by André Henriques and Dylan Thurston in 2011. The proof uses concrete computations, which we aim to be accessible to a wide audience.\n\nWe also show an explicit relation to [blank5], anticipating the real determinant lines to be pertinent to locally conformally covariant (Malliavin--Kontsevich--Suhov) measures on curves and loops, as well as to Kähler geometry and geometric quantization of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. Inherently, the conformal anomaly and real determinant line bundles are expected to be universal, following a classification of modular functors.",

We also show that results can be readily migrated to other integrable systems, with the same non-self-adjoint Zakharov-Shabat scattering problem or alike. Results for the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the complex modified Korteweg-De Vries equation are obtained as explicit examples for demonstrative purposes. A DSG is a localized coherent nonlinear traveling-wave structure, comprised of inseparable solitons with identical velocities. Hence, DSGs are generalizations of single solitons (considered as 1-DSGs), and form fundamental building blocks of solutions of many integrable systems. We provide an explicit formula for an N-DSG and its center. With the help of the [blank4], we prove the localization of DSGs, and calculate the long-time asymptotics for an arbitrary N-soliton solutions.

    "cloze_question": "We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of [blank1]. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of [blank2]: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the simple root systems A3, B2, B3 and D4. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering [blank3], that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type A3, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of [blank4] which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed A3 map and the QRT map correspond to translation by a generator in the [blank5] of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that is mutation equivalent to the q-Painlevé III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types B2, B3 and D4 are also related to elliptic surfaces.\n\nFrom a dynamical systems viewpoint, the message of the paper is that special families of birational maps with completely periodic dynamics under iteration admit natural deformations that are aperiodic yet completely integrable.",

The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to x, are derived in terms of a [blank2]. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the [blank3] along the real axis, it contains a kernel of [blank4] with respect to the weight function ω^(over)(z)=|z-overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}, so including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge.

This is done in two steps and involves a [blank5] of the weight ω^(over)(z)=|z-overline{x}|^2ω^(pre)(z), by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight ω^(pre)(z). Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size N. This allows us to take different large-N limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to ω^(over)(z) are determined.

We also identify the (nonautonomous) Hamiltonian structure associated to this equation, and write a suitable [blank5] for this system. This [blank5] can be extended to the canonical coordinates of the associated Hamiltonian system, allowing us to verify Conjectures 1. and 2. of \\cite{IP}. We also present a fairly general formula for the [blank5] of a special class of resonant connections, which is somewhat simpler than that of \\cite{BM}.",

    "cloze_question": "Our paper investigates one-dimensional Schrödinger operators defined as closed operators on L^2(ℝ) or L^2(ℝ_+) that are exactly solvable in terms of [blank1] (or, equivalently, [blank2]). We allow the potentials to be complex. They fall into three families: [blank3] (or [blank4]), Schrödinger operators with Morse potentials and isotonic oscillators. For each of them, we discuss the corresponding basic holomorphic family of closed operators and the integral kernel of their resolvents. We also describe transmutation identities that relate these resolvents. These identities interchange spectral parameters with coupling constants across different operator families.\n\nA similar analysis is performed for one-dimensional Schrödinger operators solvable in terms of [blank5] (which are reducible to special cases of Whittaker functions). They fall into two families: Bessel operators and Schrödinger operators with exponential potentials.\n\nTo make our presentation self-contained, we include a short summary of the theory of closed one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with singular boundary conditions. We also provide a concise review of special functions that we use.",

Solving the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem has however proven challenging, and prior insights mainly used the [blank4], transforming self-similar solutions into solitons propagating over infinite rescaled time horizon. Here, we further characterize Sabra blowups by implementing two strategies targeting the eigenvalue problem. The first involves formal expansion in terms of a bookkeeping parameter and interprets the self-similar solution as a (degenerate) [blank5]. Using standard bifurcation toolkits, we show that the homoclinic bifurcations identified under finite-truncation of the series converge to the observed Sabra solution. The second strategy uses machine-learning optimization to solve directly for the Sabra eigenvalue, revealing a continuous family of non-universal blowup profiles characterized by various numbers of pulses and associated exponents.",

Our methodology involves transforming initial data into scattering data via the [blank3]. Utilizing two parameter transformations, we examine the asymptotic properties of the [blank4] at both vanishing and infinite parameters, yielding two equivalent spectral problems. We subsequently devise a mapping that translates the obtained scattering data into a two-by-two matrix Riemann--Hilbert problem, incorporating several residue conditions at N pairs of multiple poles. Additionally, we construct an equivalent pole-free Riemann--Hilbert problem and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of its solution. In the reflectionless case, the N-multipole solutions can be reconstructed by resolving [blank5].",

When such expansion fulfills a set of [blank3] we prove that the ambient manifold solves the Einstein equations to infinite order at the hypersurface. Our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the dimension or topology of the null hypersurface and is entirely covariant. Furthermore, when the hypersurface exhibits a [blank4] we find the minimum amount of data on a cross-section that ensures the existence of an ambient space solving the Einstein equations to infinite order on the hypersurface. As an application we recall the notion of [blank5] introduced in \\cite{Mio3}, namely the minimal data needed to define a non-degenerate Killing horizon from a detached viewpoint, and we prove that every AKH of arbitrary dimension and topology gives rise to an ambient space solving the Lambda-vacuum equations to infinite order and with the given data as Killing horizon.

Typically, we assume that M is globally hyperbolic. Here, the term \"propagator\" refers to any Green function or bisolution of the Klein-Gordon equation pertinent to Quantum Field Theory.\n\nThe {\u001em off-shell} setting is based on the [blank2]. It leads to the definition of the [blank3], which often coincide with the so-called out-in Feynman and in-out anti-Feynman propagator. On some special spacetimes, the sum of the operator-theoretic Feynman and anti-Feynman propagator equals the sum of the forward and backward propagator. This is always true on static stable spacetimes and, curiously, in some other cases as well.\n\nThe {\u001em on-shell} setting is based on the [blank4] of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. It allows us to define 2-point functions associated to two, possibly distinct Fock states as the Klein-Gordon kernels of projectors onto [blank5] of the Krein space.\n\nAfter a general discussion, we review a number of examples. We start with static and asymptotically static spacetimes, which are especially well-suited for Quantum Field Theory. Then we discuss FLRW spacetimes, reducible by a mode decomposition to 1-dimensional Schr\u0000f6dinger operators. We compare various approaches to de Sitter space where, curiously, the off-shell approach gives non-physical propagators. Finally, we discuss anti-de Sitter spaces, both proper and their universal cover, where the on-shell approach may require boundary conditions, unlike the off-shell approach.",

For two intersecting null hypersurfaces, we generalize a previous result valid for Killings to the homothetic case and, moreover, demonstrate that the equations can be formulated solely in terms of the initial data for the characteristic Cauchy problem, i.e., without involving a priori spacetime quantities. This puts the characteristic KID problem on equal footing with the spacelike KID problem. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of the formalism by addressing the homothetic KID problem for smooth spacelike-characteristic initial data. Other initial value problems, such as the spacelike-characteristic with corners, can be approached similarly.",

Both feature that the variance of the number of Fermions (the number variance) in a set A, and the respective entanglement entropy are proportional. For the Ginibre ensemble this statement about the entropy was known for radial symmetric sets A, and we prove it in generality for subsets A of the bulk, thus establishing a [blank2]. Moreover, for generic random normal matrix ensembles depending on some potential V, not necessarily exhibiting radial symmetry, we show that for large matrix size n the number variance is proportional to the [blank3], ~√n|∂A|. A special focus is on the variance of linear statistics of the [blank4], which interpolates between the GUE and Ginibre ensemble, in various regimes of non-Hermiticity, where we enlarge the concept of weak non-Hermiticity to mesoscopic scales. Within the elliptic Ginibre ensemble we prove that for smooth test functions f its variance interpolates between that of the GUE and Ginibre ensemble. The interpolation depends on two positive parameters, the rescaling α of the weak non-Hermiticity parameter τ=1−κ n^{−α}, and the rescaling γ of the test function f(n^γ z), for a continuous range of values of α and γ.

    "cloze_question": "In a recent work, [blank1] proposed a geometric notion of initial data on big bang singularities. Moreover, he conjectured that initial data on the singularity could be used to parameterize [blank2]; that is, roughly speaking, solutions whose leading order asymptotics are convergent. We prove that given initial data on the singularity for the [blank3] in four spacetime dimensions, as defined by Ringström, there is a corresponding unique development of the data. We do not assume any symmetry or analyticity, and we allow for arbitrary closed spatial topology. Our results thus present an important step towards resolving Ringström's conjecture. Furthermore, our results show that the Einstein--nonlinear scalar field equations have a geometric singular initial value problem formulation, which is analogous to the classical result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch for initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface.\n\nIn the literature, there are two conditions which are expected to ensure that quiescent behavior occurs. The first one is an [blank4]. The second one is an algebraic condition on the eigenvalues of the [blank5] associated with a foliation of the spacetime near the singularity. Our result is the first such result where both possibilities are allowed. That is, we allow for the first condition to ensure quiescence in one region of space and for the second condition to take over in the region where the first one is violated. This fact allows for our results to include the vacuum setting. We expect that all current results in the literature where the authors specify data on a big bang singularity and then construct a corresponding solution, to the Einstein vacuum or Einstein--scalar field equations in four spacetime dimensions, with closed spatial topology, and where the limits of the eigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map are everywhere distinct, should be special cases of our results.",

    "cloze_question": "Motivated by understanding the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of spacetimes admitting [blank1], such as ultracompact objects and black string solutions to general relativity, we explore the dynamics of nonlinear scalar waves on a simple (fixed) model geometry with stable trapping. More specifically, we consider the time evolution of solutions to the [blank2] on a four-dimensional static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat (horizonless) spacetime admitting a stable photon sphere.\n\nUnlike the known results for scalar waves on spacetimes with unstable trapping, our study shows fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear scalar dynamics. The local energy, as well as all local higher-order energies, of solutions to the linear wave equation on our model spacetime can be rigorously proven to remain [blank3] and to decay uniformly in time. However, due to the presence of stable trapping, the uniform decay rate is slow. To help elucidate how the slow linear decay affects solutions to the nonlinear wave equation considered, we examine numerical solutions of the latter, restricting to axisymmetric initial data in this work. In contrast to the linear dynamics, we exhibit a family of nonlinear solutions with [blank4]. Within the region of stable trapping, the slow linear decay allows local higher-order energies of the nonlinear solution to grow over the time interval that we numerically evolve. The growth is induced by a [blank5]: Beginning with initial data containing a small number of low-order multipole modes, a spectrum of high-order multipole modes are populated in time by the nonlinear interactions and eventually dominate over the low-modes in the evolution.\n\nThat the system exhibits a direct cascade limits the time over which our numerical scheme can provide convergent solutions for the short-wavelength structure that develops, and hence we can only speculate what this intermediate-time dynamics implies for the nonlinear stability of the motivating spacetimes in general relativity. Nevertheless, we provide a heuristic argument suggesting that, if a similar behaviour occurs for gravitational wave perturbations of these spacetimes, it would likely not generically lead to black hole or singularity formation.",

To overcome the difficulty arising from the orders of singularities at the vortices, a [blank4] and a monotone iteration method are employed.

However, the free energy is not generally invariant under the swap of x and y; thus, the difference [blank1] - [blank2] is nonzero.\n\nWe derive a new formula for this difference for all g\\geq 2 in terms of a [blank4] at the singularities of x and y, including cases where x and y have logarithmic singularities. For the derivation, we apply recent developments from x-y duality within the theory of (Logarithmic) Topological Recursion. The derived formulas are particularly useful for spectral curves with a trivial x-y dual side, meaning those with vanishing [blank2]. In such cases, one obtains an explicit result for F_{g\\geq 2} itself.\n\nWe apply this to several classes of spectral curves and prove, for instance, a recent conjecture by Borot et al. that the free energies F_g computed by Topological Recursion for the [blank5] coincide with the perturbative part (in the \\Omega-background) of the [blank6] of \\mathcal{N}=2 pure supersymmetric gauge theory.

[blank3] associated to the expectations of these invariants are defined through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.\n\nTwo important cases are considered asymptotically: pure random tensors that scale like a complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants associated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas involving summations over [blank4]. The pure and mixed cases involve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the distribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a sum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of higher orders is provided.\n\n[blank5] is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order tensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic moments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic construction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative probability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of these spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor freeness of the subspaces they generate.",

We prove a [blank4] between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful [blank5] for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.",

Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a [blank4] for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on [blank4] to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the [blank5]. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the [blank5], presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and simulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising free energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.",

Building upon the [blank2], we keep the pressure and forces coupled, formulate the pressure-forces corrections system, solve for pressure-forces corrections, then perform a projection-correction step for velocities followed by a correction step for pressure and forces. To solve the pressure-forces system, we apply a block reduction and suggest an efficient preconditioning approach that is based on using the [blank3] for the resulting Schur complement. The Laplacian, being independent of the coordinates of the immersed body, is factorized only once (using an efficient direct method) and is then reused throughout the simulation. We present a rigorous proof of the [blank4] of the Laplacian and the Schur complement, thereby showing that the preconditioner's efficiency is independent of the grid resolution.\n\nThe performance of the method is validated through simulations of the flow around a [blank5] in a three-dimensional box. The methodology is then applied to analyze flows generated by arrays of 7 and 14 sub-spheres modeling porous spheres of different porosities. We show good scalability of the algorithm in terms of computational time and memory consumptions. That is, the iteration count for the preconditioned pressure-forces system is nearly constant, regardless of the grid resolution, Reynolds number, and the number of spheres.

    "cloze_question": "A Chern-Simons matrix model was proposed by Dorey, Tong, and Turner to describe non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall effect. In this paper we study the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model from a [blank1] point of view. We show that the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model can be identified with the space of sections of a line bundle on the quiver variety associated to a [blank2]. We compute the character of the Hilbert space using [blank3]. Using a natural isomorphism between vortex moduli space and a [blank4], we prove that the ground states wave functions are flat sections of a bundle of conformal blocks associated to a WZW model. In particular they solve a [blank5]. We show that there exists a natural action of the deformed double current algebra (DDCA) on the Hilbert space, moreover the action is irreducible.\n\nWe define and study the conformal limit of the Chern-Simons matrix model. We show that the conformal limit of the Hilbert space is an irreducible integrable module of the affine general linear algebra with level identified with the matrix model level. Moreover, we prove that the affine generators can be obtained from scaling limits of matrix model operators, which settles a conjecture of Dorey-Tong-Turner. The key to the proof is the construction of a Yangian action on the conformal limit of the Hilbert space, which we expect to be equivalent to the Yangian action on the integrable affine modules constructed by Uglov. We also characterize eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix model Hilbert space with respect to a maximal commutative subalgebra of Yangian.",

    "cloze_question": "Building on the interplay between geometry and integrability, we show that [blank1] are the geometric counterpart of integrable systems of quasilinear first order evolutionary PDEs. We consider F-manifolds equipped with an [blank2] and assume that the operator L=E\\circ is regular. This generalises previous results in the semisimple context. As an example we study regular F-manifolds with compatible connection (\\nabla,\\circ,e,E) associated with integrable hierarchies obtained from the solutions of the equation d\\cdot d_L a_0=0 by applying the construction of \\cite{LM}. We show that n-dimensional F-manifolds associated to operators L with r\\le n [blank3] of size m_\\alpha are classified by [blank4], where each block L_\\alpha contributes with m_\\alpha functions of the variable appearing in the diagonal of the block. In the case of a single Jordan block of arbitrary size we show that flat connections \\nabla correspond to linear solutions a_0. This generalises part of the construction of \\cite{LP23} where special linear solutions were considered. We illustrate the construction in dimensions 2,3, and 4 for any choice of Jordan canonical form and any choice of the corresponding solution a_0. In these dimensions we have that linear solutions define [blank5], and that the special linear solutions studied in \\cite{LP23} are related to Riemannian F-manifolds with Killing unit vector field. We conjecture that this is true in general.",

    "cloze_question": "Within the framework of the [blank1], the theory of [blank2] is established for the defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation with local and nonlocal nonlinearities (which originates from the parity-symmetric reduction of the Manakov system) under non-zero boundary conditions. First, the [blank3] and auxiliary eigenfunctions are introduced for the direct scattering, and the analyticity, symmetries of eigenfunctions and scattering matrix are studied in detail. Then, the distribution of discrete eigenvalues is examined, and the asymptotic behaviors of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are analyzed rigorously. Compared with the Manakov system, the [blank4] introduces an additional symmetry, leading to stricter constraints on eigenfunctions, scattering coefficients and norming constants. Further, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated for the the inverse problem with the scattering coefficients admitting an arbitrary number of simple zeros. For the reflectionless case, the [blank5] are presented in the determinant form. With N=1, the dark and beating one-soliton solutions are obtained, which are respectively associated with a pair of discrete eigenvalues lying on and off the circle on the spectrum plane. Via the asymptotic analysis, the two-soliton solutions are found to admit the interactions between two dark solitons or two beating solitons, as well as the superpositions of two beating solitons or one beating soliton and one dark soliton.\n\nKeywords: Inverse scattering transform; Nonlinear Schrödinger equation; N-soliton solutions; Riemann-Hilbert method",
