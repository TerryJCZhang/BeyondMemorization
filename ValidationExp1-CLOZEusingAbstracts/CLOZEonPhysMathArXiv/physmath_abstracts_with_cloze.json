    "abstract": "A subset $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is in \\emph{general position} if no shortest path in $G$ contains three vertices of $S$. The \\emph{general position problem} consists of finding the number of vertices in a largest general position set of $G$, whilst the \\emph{lower general position problem} asks for a smallest maximal general position set. In this paper we determine the lower general position numbers of several families of Cartesian products. We also show that the existence of small maximal general position sets in a Cartesian product is connected to a special type of general position set in the factors, which we call a \\emph{terminal set}, for which adding any vertex $u$ from outside the set creates three vertices in a line with $u$ as an endpoint. We give a constructive proof of the existence of terminal sets for graphs with diameter at most three. We also present conjectures on the existence of terminal sets for all graphs and a lower bound on the lower general position number of a Cartesian product in terms of the lower general position numbers of its factors.",

    "title": "The numeraire e-variable and reverse information projection",
    "date": "2024-02-01",
    "abstract": "We consider testing a composite null hypothesis $\\mathcal{P}$ against a point alternative $\\mathsf{Q}$ using e-variables, which are nonnegative random variables $X$ such that $\\mathbb{E}_\\mathsf{P}[X] \\leq 1$ for every $\\mathsf{P} \\in \\mathcal{P}$. This paper establishes a fundamental result: under no conditions whatsoever on $\\mathcal{P}$ or $\\mathsf{Q}$, there exists a special e-variable $X^*$ that we call the numeraire, which is strictly positive and satisfies $\\mathbb{E}_\\mathsf{Q}[X/X^*] \\leq 1$ for every other e-variable $X$. In particular, $X^*$ is log-optimal in the sense that $\\mathbb{E}_\\mathsf{Q}[\\log(X/X^*)] \\leq 0$. Moreover, $X^*$ identifies a particular sub-probability measure $\\mathsf{P}^*$ via the density $d \\mathsf{P}^*/d \\mathsf{Q} = 1/X^*$. As a result, $X^*$ can be seen as a generalized likelihood ratio of $\\mathsf{Q}$ against $\\mathcal{P}$. We show that $\\mathsf{P}^*$ coincides with the reverse information projection (RIPr) when additional assumptions are made that are required for the latter to exist. Thus $\\mathsf{P}^*$ is a natural definition of the RIPr in the absence of any assumptions on $\\mathcal{P}$ or $\\mathsf{Q}$. In addition to the abstract theory, we provide several tools for finding the numeraire and RIPr in concrete cases. We discuss several nonparametric examples where we can indeed identify the numeraire and RIPr, despite not having a reference measure. Our results have interpretations outside of testing in that they yield the optimal Kelly bet against $\\mathcal{P}$ if we believe reality follows $\\mathsf{Q}$. We end with a more general optimality theory that goes beyond the ubiquitous logarithmic utility. We focus on certain power utilities, leading to reverse Rényi projections in place of the RIPr, which also always exist.",

This paper establishes a fundamental result: under no conditions whatsoever on \\mathcal{P} or \\mathsf{Q}, there exists a special e-variable X^* that we call the [blank2], which is strictly positive and satisfies \\mathbb{E}_\\mathsf{Q}[X/X^*] \\leq 1 for every other e-variable X. In particular, X^* is log-optimal in the sense that \\mathbb{E}_\\mathsf{Q}[\\log(X/X^*)] \\leq 0. Moreover, X^* identifies a particular [blank3] \\mathsf{P}^* via the density d \\mathsf{P}^*/d \\mathsf{Q} = 1/X^*. As a result, X^* can be seen as a generalized likelihood ratio of \\mathsf{Q} against \\mathcal{P}. We show that \\mathsf{P}^* coincides with the [blank4] when additional assumptions are made that are required for the latter to exist. Thus \\mathsf{P}^* is a natural definition of the RIPr in the absence of any assumptions on \\mathcal{P} or \\mathsf{Q}. In addition to the abstract theory, we provide several tools for finding the numeraire and RIPr in concrete cases. We discuss several nonparametric examples where we can indeed identify the numeraire and RIPr, despite not having a reference measure. Our results have interpretations outside of testing in that they yield the optimal [blank5] against \\mathcal{P} if we believe reality follows \\mathsf{Q}. We end with a more general optimality theory that goes beyond the ubiquitous logarithmic utility. We focus on certain power utilities, leading to reverse Rényi projections in place of the RIPr, which also always exist.",

    "date": "2024-05-01",
    "abstract": "Decentralized stochastic control problems with local information involve problems where multiple agents and subsystems which are coupled via dynamics and/or cost are present. Typically, however, the dynamics of such couplings is complex and difficult to precisely model, leading to questions on robustness in control design. Additionally, when such a coupling can be modeled, the problem arrived at is typically challenging and non-convex, due to decentralization of information. In this paper, we develop a robustness framework for optimal decentralized control of interacting agents, where we show that a decentralized control problem with interacting agents can be robustly designed by considering a risk-sensitive version of non-interacting agents/particles. This leads to a tractable robust formulation where we give a bound on the value of the cost function in terms of the risk-sensitive cost function for the non-interacting case plus a term involving the ``strength\" of the interaction as measured by relative entropy. We will build on Gaussian measure theory and an associated variational equality. A particular application includes mean-field models consisting of (a generally large number of) interacting agents which are often hard to solve for the case with small or moderate numbers of agents, leading to an interest in effective approximations and robustness. By adapting a risk-sensitivity parameter, we also robustly control a non-symmetrically interacting  problem with mean-field cost by one which is symmetric with a risk-sensitive criterion, and in the limit of small interactions, show the stability of optimal solutions to perturbations.",

Here we give a negative answer to this question    by constructing an order-preserving bijection between this class and a class of real measurable odd periodic functions bounded in absolute value by 1/2. Each member of the latter class defines a Moln{\\'a}r mean by an explicit exponential-integral representation. From this we are able to understand the order structure of the Moln\\'ar class and construct several infinite families of explicit examples of Moln{\\'a}r means that are not the geometric mean.

    "cloze_question": "We provide a complete characterization of a subclass of weakly associative means of positive operators in the class of symmetric Kubo-Ando means. This class, which includes the [blank2], was first introduced and studied in L. Molnár, \\textit{Characterizations of certain means of positive operators}, Linear Algebra Appl. 567 (2019) 143-166, where he gives a characterization of this subclass (which we call the [blank1]) in terms of the properties of their representing operator monotone functions. Molnár's paper leaves open the problem of determining if the [blank2] is the only such mean in that subclass. Here we give a negative answer to this question by constructing an [blank3] between this class and a class of [blank4] bounded in absolute value by 1/2. Each member of the latter class defines a Molnár mean by an explicit [blank5]. From this we are able to understand the order structure of the Molnár class and construct several infinite families of explicit examples of Molnár means that are not the [blank2]. Our analysis also shows how to modify Molnár’s original characterization so that the [blank2] is the only one satisfying the requisite set of properties.",

In this sense, our work falls under the `proof mining' program, and indeed, our quantitative results provide new examples of the phenomenon, recently made precise by the first author and Pischke, that many proofs in probability theory are proof-theoretically tame, and amenable to the extraction of quantitative data that is both of low complexity and independent of the underlying probability space.",

We define a [blank3] to be a chord joining a vertex interior to a [blank2] to one exterior to it. Building on earlier work, we investigate the distribution of [blank3]s in the limit of large [blank2]s and diagrams, and show that the number of [blank3]s is [blank4], obtaining expressions for the associated mean and variance as a function of [blank2] size. We introduce the notion of a crystallized diagram, defined by the criteria that all its chords are either [blank1]s or are [blank3]s. We count the number of crystallized diagrams by the number of [blank1]s they contain, and provide the asymptotic distribution in the limit of large crystallized diagrams.

Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural coercivity and polyconvexity conditions, assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable.

For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of affinely related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone.

However, large classes of systems with distinct transient dynamics can still exhibit the same asymptotic statistical behavior, which poses challenges when invariant measures alone are used to perform system identification. Motivated by Takens' seminal embedding theory, we propose studying invariant measures in time-delay coordinates, which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the underlying dynamics. Our first result demonstrates that a single invariant measure in time-delay coordinates can be used to perform system identification up to a topological conjugacy. This result already surpasses the capabilities of invariant measures in the original state coordinate. Continuing to explore the power of delay-coordinates, we eliminate all ambiguity from the conjugacy relation by showing that unique system identification can be achieved using additional invariant measures in time-delay coordinates constructed from different observables.

We finally propose a conjecture relating the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential as the evaluation of the Hamiltonian differential in these Darboux coordinates that could provide insights on the geometric interpretation of the formal parameter.",

We also show that results can be readily migrated to other integrable systems, with the same non-self-adjoint Zakharov-Shabat scattering problem or alike. Results for the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the complex modified Korteweg-De Vries equation are obtained as explicit examples for demonstrative purposes. A DSG is a localized coherent nonlinear traveling-wave structure, comprised of inseparable solitons with identical velocities. Hence, DSGs are generalizations of single solitons (considered as 1-DSGs), and form fundamental building blocks of solutions of many integrable systems. We provide an explicit formula for an N-DSG and its center. With the help of the [blank4], we prove the localization of DSGs, and calculate the long-time asymptotics for an arbitrary N-soliton solutions. It is shown that the solution becomes a linear combination of multiple DSGs in the distant past and future, with explicit formulæ for the [blank5] for each DSG. Other generalizations of a single soliton are also discussed, such as Nth-order solitons and soliton gases. We prove that every Nth-order soliton can be obtained by fusion of eigenvalues of N-soliton solutions, with proper rescalings of norming constants, and demonstrate that soliton-gas solution can be considered as limits of N-soliton solutions as N→+∞.",

Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle.

We show that $n$-dimensional F-manifolds associated to operators $L$ with $r\\le n$ Jordan blocks $L_\\alpha$ of  size $m_\\alpha$ are classified by $n$ arbitrary functions of a single variable, where each block $L_\\alpha$ contributes with $m_\\alpha$ functions of the  variable  appearing in the  diagonal of the block. In the case of a single Jordan block of arbitrary size we show that flat connections $\\nabla$ correspond to linear solutions  $a_0$. This generalises part of the construction of \\cite{LP23} where special linear solutions were considered. We illustrate the construction in dimensions $2,3,$ and $4$ for any choice of Jordan canonical form and any choice of the corresponding solution $a_0$. In these dimensions we have that linear solutions define bi-flat F-manifolds, and that  the special linear solutions studied in \\cite{LP23} are related to Riemannian F-manifolds with Killing unit vector field. We conjecture that this is true in general.",
