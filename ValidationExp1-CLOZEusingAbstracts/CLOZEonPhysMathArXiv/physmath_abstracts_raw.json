This paper establishes a fundamental result: under no conditions whatsoever on $\\mathcal{P}$ or $\\mathsf{Q}$, there exists a special e-variable $X^*$ that we call the numeraire, which is strictly positive and satisfies $\\mathbb{E}_\\mathsf{Q}[X/X^*] \\leq 1$ for every other e-variable $X$.

Moreover, $X^*$ identifies a particular sub-probability measure $\\mathsf{P}^*$ via the density $d \\mathsf{P}^*/d \\mathsf{Q} = 1/X^*$. As a result, $X^*$ can be seen as a generalized likelihood ratio of $\\mathsf{Q}$ against $\\mathcal{P}$.

In addition to the abstract theory, we provide several tools for finding the numeraire and RIPr in concrete cases.

Our main theorem is that $C_p(X)$ is strongly \\v{S}anin whenever $X$ is a submetrizable space; this improves an earlier result due to Tkachuk: $C_p(X)$ is \\v{S}anin whenever $X$ is a submetrizable space. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions to characterize the calibers of $C_p(X)$ when $X$ is a topological sum, and we calculate the calibers of $C_p(X)$ when $X = \\prod_{\\xi < \\lambda}X_\\xi$ is a product of non-trivial Tychonoff spaces with $i$-weight $\\leq \\lambda$. Furthermore, we calculate the calibers of $C_p(X)$ when $X$ is an interval of ordinals and when $X$ is the one-point $\\lambda$-Lindelöf extension of a discrete space of cardinality $\\geq \\lambda$. This allows to give examples of compact Hausdorff spaces $Z$ such that $iw(Z)=\\kappa^{+}$ and $C_p(Z^{\\kappa})$ does not have caliber $iw(Z)$; and examples of spaces $\\{Z_\\alpha : \\alpha<\\cf(\\kappa)\\}$ such that $\\kappa$ is a caliber for $C_p(Z_\\alpha)$ whenever $\\alpha<\\cf(\\kappa)$ but it is not a caliber for $C_p(\\bigoplus_{\\alpha<\\cf(\\kappa)} Z_\\alpha)$.",

Working in a suitable theory, we are able to represent functions on proof trees as yet further proof trees satisfying a suitable analog of well-foundedness. Iterating this process allows us to represent higher order functions as well: since functions on proof trees are just proof trees themselves, these functions can easily be extended to act on proof trees which are themselves understood as functions.

    "abstract": "The density of a rational language can be understood as the frequency of some ``pattern'' in the shift space, for example a pattern like ``words with an even number of a given letter.''   We study the density of group languages, i.e. rational languages recognized by morphisms onto finite groups, inside shift spaces. We show that the density with respect to any given ergodic measure on a shift space exists for every group language, because it can be computed by using any ergodic lift of the given measure to some skew product between the shift space and the recognizing group. We then further study densities in shifts of finite type (with a suitable notion of irreducibility), and then in minimal shifts. In the latter case, we obtain a closed formula for the density under the condition that the skew product has minimal closed invariant subsets which are ergodic under the product of the original measure and the uniform probability measure on the group. The formula is derived in part from a characterization of minimal closed invariant subsets for skew products relying on notions of cocycles and coboundaries. In the case where the whole skew product is ergodic under the product measure, then the density is just the cardinality of the subset of the group which defines the language divided by the cardinality of the group. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions for the skew product to have minimal closed invariant subsets that are ergodic under the product measure. Finally, we investigate the link between minimal closed invariant subsets, return words and bifix codes.",

The behavior of optimal control in high-order problems lacks precise characterization, and even the existence of the chattering phenomenon, i.e., the control switches for infinitely many times over a finite period, remains unknown and overlooked. This paper establishes a theoretical framework for chattering phenomena in the considered problem, providing novel findings on the uniqueness of state constraints inducing chattering, the upper bound of switching times in an unconstrained arc during chattering, and the convergence of states and costates to the chattering limit point. For the first time, this paper proves the existence of the chattering phenomenon in the considered problem. The chattering optimal control for 4th-order problems with velocity constraints is precisely solved, providing an approach to plan time-optimal snap-limited trajectories. Other cases of order $n\\leq4$ are proved not to allow chattering. The conclusions rectify a longstanding misconception in the industry concerning the time-optimality of S-shaped trajectories with minimal switching times.",

Typically, however, the dynamics of such couplings is complex and difficult to precisely model, leading to questions on robustness in control design. Additionally, when such a coupling can be modeled, the problem arrived at is typically challenging and non-convex, due to decentralization of information. In this paper, we develop a robustness framework for optimal decentralized control of interacting agents, where we show that a decentralized control problem with interacting agents can be robustly designed by considering a risk-sensitive version of non-interacting agents/particles. This leads to a tractable robust formulation where we give a bound on the value of the cost function in terms of the risk-sensitive cost function for the non-interacting case plus a term involving the ``strength\" of the interaction as measured by relative entropy. We will build on Gaussian measure theory and an associated variational equality. A particular application includes mean-field models consisting of (a generally large number of) interacting agents which are often hard to solve for the case with small or moderate numbers of agents, leading to an interest in effective approximations and robustness. By adapting a risk-sensitivity parameter, we also robustly control a non-symmetrically interacting  problem with mean-field cost by one which is symmetric with a risk-sensitive criterion, and in the limit of small interactions, show the stability of optimal solutions to perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Naisse and Vaz defined an extension of KLR algebras to categorify Verma modules. We realise these algebras geometrically as convolution algebras in Borel--Moore homology. For this we introduce \\emph{Grassmannian--Steinberg quiver flag varieties}. They generalize Steinberg quiver flag varieties in a non-obvious way, reflecting the diagrammatics from the Naisse--Vaz construction.  Using different kind of stratifications we provide geometric explanations of the rather mysterious algebraic and diagrammatic basis theorems. \n\nA geometric categorification of Verma modules was recently found in the special case of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$  by Rouquier. Rouquier's construction uses coherent sheaves on certain quasi-map spaces to flag varieties (zastavas), whereas our construction is implicitly based on perverse sheaves. Both should be seen as parts (on dual sides) of a general geometric framework for the Naisse--Vaz approach. \n\nWe first treat the (substantially easier) $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ case in detail and construct as a byproduct a geometric dg-model of the nil-Hecke algebras. The extra difficulties we encounter in general require the use of more complicated Grassmannian--Steinberg quiver flag varieties. Their definition arises from combinatorially defined \\emph{diagram varieties} which we assign to each Naisse--Vaz basis diagram. Our explicit analysis here might shed some light on categories of coherent sheaves on more general zastava spaces studied by Feigin--Finkelberg--Kuznetsov--Mirkovi{\\'c} and Braverman,  which we expect to occur in a generalization of Rouquier's construction away from $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$.",

We first prove the global existence of  weak solutions to 2-D (INS) with bounded initial density and initial velocity in $L^2(\\mathbb R^2)$. Moreover, if the initial density is bounded away from zero, then our weak solution equals to Lions' weak solution, which in particular implies the uniqueness of Lions' weak solution. We also extend a celebrated result by Fujita and Kato on the 3-D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to 3-D (INS): {\\it  the global well-posedness of 3-D (INS) with bounded initial density and initial velocity being small in $\\dot H^{1/2}(\\mathbb R^3)$}. \n The proof of the uniqueness is based on a surprising finding that the estimate $t^{1/2}\\nabla u\\in L^2(0,T; L^\\infty(\\mathbb R^d))$ instead of $\\nabla u\\in L^1(0, T; L^\\infty(\\mathbb R^d))$ is enough to ensure the uniqueness of the solution.",

For noncommutative rings, the notion of multiplicity first appeared in the context of modules for the Weyl algebra in Bernstein's solution of the problem of analytic continuation posed by I. Gelfand. The notion was shown to be useful to many more noncommutative rings, especially enveloping algebras, rings of differential operators, and quantum groups. In all these cases, the existence of multiplicity is related to the existence of Hilbert-Samuel polynomials. In this work we give an axiomatic definition of algebras with a notion of multiplicity, which we call \\emph{very nice} and \\emph{modest algebras}. We show, in an abstract setting, how the existence of Hilbert-Samuel polynomials implies the existence of a notion of multiplicity. We apply our results for the category of \\emph{min-holonomic} modules --- a notion which coincides with holonomic modules for simple algebras --- and that shares many similarities with it. In particular, we generalize the usual results in the literature that are stated for Ore domains, in the more general context of prime algebras, and we show that rational Cherednik algebras admit a notion of multiplicity.",

Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural coercivity and polyconvexity conditions, assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable. Variants of the existence theorem are also proved, first under the constraint that  finite sets of landmark points in the two images are mapped one to the other, and second when one image is to be compared to an unknown part of another.\n\nThe question is studied as to whether for  images related by an affine mapping the unique minimiser is given by that affine mapping.  For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of affinely related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone. This suggests a new model in which the integrand  depends also on second derivatives of the transformation, and an example is given for which both existence of minimisers is assured and the above property holds for all pairs of affinely related images.",

There are broadly two types of these companions: the left and the right variable inclusion companions. Another type of companions of logics induced by Hilbert-style presentations (Hilbert-style logics) were introduced in \\cite{BasuChakraborty2021}. A sufficient condition for the restricted rules companion of a Hilbert-style logic to coincide with its left variable inclusion companion was proved there, while a necessary condition remained elusive. The present article has two parts. In the first part, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the left variable inclusion and the restricted rules companions of a Hilbert-style logic to coincide. In the rest of the paper, we recognize that the variable inclusion restrictions used to define variable inclusion companions of a logic $\\langle\\lang,\\vdash\\rangle$ are relations from $\\pow(\\lang)$ to $\\lang$. This leads to a more general idea of a relational companion of a logical structure, a framework that we borrow from the field of universal logic.

We show precise representation formulas and comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we call ``infinitesimally strict concavity'' (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian structures and established here  for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the associated  distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts formula. This   treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric geometry expands upon its recent nonlinear yet elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth case, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut locus. Two central ingredients our  contribution unifies are the localization paradigm of Cavalletti--Mondino and the  Sobolev calculus of Beran--Braun--Calisti--Gigli--McCann--Ohanyan--Rott--S\\\"amann.\n\nIn the second part of our work, we present several applications of these insights. First, we show the  equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension condition with a Bochner-type inequality. Second, we set up synthetic mean curvature (as well as barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove synthetic volume and area estimates of Heintze--Karcher-type, which enable  us to show several synthetic volume singularity theorems.",

Our analysis introduces newly characterized conditions on the interaction kernel that ensure the local asymptotic stability of the unique steady state.  Compared to previous works on this topic, our results allow for large, singular and non-symmetric interactions. As a corollary of our main results, we show exponential decay of solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equation in dimension $3$, for low regularity initial data. In the repulsive case, the result holds in strongly nonlinear regimes (\\emph{i.e.} for arbitrarily small Debye length). Our techniques rely on the design of new Lyapunov functionals based on hypocoercivity and hypoellipticity theories.

We define the set of \\emph{identity states} for pairs of draws via a series of actions by permutation groups, describing the enumeration of all such states for a given $K \\geq 2$ and $I \\geq 2$. Given two probability vectors for the $I$ objects, we compute the probability of each identity state. From the set of all such probabilities, we obtain the expectation for a dissimilarity measure, finding that it has a simple form that generalizes a result previously obtained for the case of $K=2$. We determine when the expected dissimilarity between two draws from the same probability distribution exceeds that of two draws taken from different probability distributions. We interpret the results in the setting of the genetics of polyploid organisms, those whose genetic material contains many copies of the genome ($K > 2$).",

    "abstract": "We consider a generalization of the so-called elephant random walk by introducing multiple elephants moving along the integer line, $\\mathbb{Z}$. When taking a new step, each elephant considers not only its own previous steps but also the past steps of other elephants. The dynamics of ``who follows whom\" are governed by a directed graph, where each vertex represents an elephant, and the edges indicate that an elephant will consider the past steps of its in-neighbour elephants when deciding its next move. In other words, this model involves a collection of reinforced random walks evolving through graph-based interactions. We briefly investigate the first- and second-order asymptotic behaviour of the joint walks and establish connections with other network-based reinforced stochastic processes studied in the literature. We show that the joint walk can be expressed as a stochastic approximation scheme. In certain regimes, we employ tools from stochastic approximation theory to derive the asymptotic properties of the joint walks. Additionally, in a specific regime, we use better techniques to establish a strong invariance principle and a central limit theorem with improved rates compared to existing results in the stochastic approximation literature. These techniques can also be used to strengthen equivalent results in stochastic approximation theory. As a byproduct, we establish a strong invariance principle for the simple elephant random walk with significantly improved rates.",

In this paper, we study the joint distribution of monochromatic hyperedges for hypergraphs with multiple layers (multiplex hypergraphs). Specifically, we consider the joint distribution of $\\bm T _n:= (T(H_n^{(1)}), T(H_n^{(2)}))$, for two sequences of hypergraphs $H_n^{(1)}$ and $H_n^{(2)}$ on the same set of vertices. We will show that the joint distribution of $\\bm T_n $ converges to (possibly dependent) Poisson distributions whenever the mean vector and the covariance matrix of $\\bm T_n$ converge. In other words, the joint Poisson approximation of $\\bm T_n$ is determined only by the convergence of its first two moments. \n    This generalizes recent results on the second moment phenomenon for Poisson approximation from graph coloring to hypergraph coloring and from marginal convergence to joint convergence. Applications include generalizations of the birthday problem, counting monochromatic subgraphs in randomly colored graphs, and counting monochromatic arithmetic progressions in randomly colored integers.

However, large classes of systems with distinct transient dynamics can still exhibit the same asymptotic statistical behavior, which poses challenges when invariant measures alone are used to perform system identification. Motivated by Takens' seminal embedding theory, we propose studying invariant measures in time-delay coordinates, which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the underlying dynamics. Our first result demonstrates that a single invariant measure in time-delay coordinates can be used to perform system identification up to a topological conjugacy. This result already surpasses the capabilities of invariant measures in the original state coordinate. Continuing to explore the power of delay-coordinates, we eliminate all ambiguity from the conjugacy relation by showing that unique system identification can be achieved using additional invariant measures in time-delay coordinates constructed from different observables. Our findings improve the effectiveness of invariant measures in system identification and broaden the scope of measure-theoretic approaches to modeling dynamical systems.",

Using the theory of Markov chains of random walks and the interchange process, it was proved that the algebraic connectivities (second smallest Laplacian eigenvalues) of $G$ and $F_k(G)$ coincide, but a combinatorial/algebraic proof has been shown elusive. In this paper, we use the latter approach and prove that such equality holds for different new classes of graphs under perturbations, such as extended cycles, extended complete bipartite graphs, kite graphs, and graphs with a cut clique.\nKite graphs are formed by a graph (head) with several paths (tail) rooted at the same vertex and with exciting properties. For instance, we show that the different eigenvalues of a kite graph are also eigenvalues of its perturbed graph obtained by adding edges.\nMoreover, as a particular case of one of our theorems, we generalize a recent result of Barik and Verma \\cite{bv24} about graphs with a cut vertex of degree $n-1$. \nAlong the way, we give conditions under which the perturbed graph $G+uv$, with $uv\\in E$, has the same algebraic connectivity as $G$.",

The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling-invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results.\nAdditionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.\n\nIn the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.",

We focus on the particular case of the nearly-linear inelastic collapse, when the order of collisions becomes eventually the infinite repetition of the period \\circled{0}-\\circled{1}, \\circled{0}-\\circled{2}, under the assumption that the relative velocities of the particles (with respect to the central particle \\circled{0}) do not vanish at the time of collapse. Taking as starting point the full dynamical system that describes two consecutive collisions of the nearly-linear collapse, we derive formally a two-dimensional dynamical system, called the two-collision mapping. This mapping governs the evolution of the variables of the full dynamical system. We show in particular that in the so-called Zhou-Kadanoff regime, the orbits of the two-collision mapping can be described in full detail. We study rigorously the two-collision mapping, proving that the Zhou-Kadanoff regime is stable and locally attracting in a certain region of the phase space of the two-collision mapping. We describe all the fixed points of the two-collision mapping in the case when the norms of the relative velocities tend to the same positive limit. We establish conjectures to characterize the orbits that verify the Zhou-Kadanoff regime, motivated by numerical simulations, and we prove these conjectures for a simplified version of the two-collision mapping.",

Rigorous Statistical Mechanics is centered on the mathematical study of statistical systems. Central concepts in this field have a natural expression in terms of diagrams in a category that couples measurable maps and Markov kernels \\cite{10.1007/978-3-031-38271-0_26}. We showed that statistical systems are particular representations of partially ordered sets (posets), that we call $\\mathcal{A}$-specifications, and expressed their phases, i.e., Gibbs measures, as invariants of these representations. It opens the way to the use of homological algebra to compute phases of statistical systems. Two central results of rigorous Statistical Mechanics are, firstly, the characterization of extreme Gibbs measure as it relates to the zero–one law for extreme Gibbs measures, and, secondly, their variational principle which states that for translation invariant Hamiltonians, Gibbs measures are the minima of the Gibbs free energy. We showed in \\cite{sergeantperthuis:hal-04456412} how the characterization of extreme Gibbs measures extends to $\\mathcal{A}$-specifications; we proposed in \\cite{sergeantperthuis2022regionalized} an Entropy functional for $\\mathcal{A}$-specifications and gave a message-passing algorithm, that generalized the belief propagation algorithm of graphical models (see O. Peltre's SYCO 8 talk, \\cite{PeltrePhD} and \\cite{yedidia_constructing_2005}), to minimize variational free energy.",

Specifically, we are able to explicitly compute the \\textit{susceptibility matrix} and the \\textit{current-field} correlation matrix in terms of the density of states of the Volterra lattice endowed with a Generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we apply the theory of linear Generalized Hydrodynamics to describe the Euler scale behavior of the correlation functions. We anticipate that the solution to the Generalized Hydrodynamics equations develops shocks at $\\xi_0=\\frac{x}{t}$; so this linear approximation does not fully describe the behavior of correlation functions. Intrigued by this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior.

The average nodal count, averaged over all eigenvectors of a given matrix, is known to be bounded between $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\\frac{n-1}{2}+\\beta(G)$, where $\\beta(G)$ is the first Betti number of $G$ (a topological quantity), and it was believed that generically the average should be around $\\frac{n-1}{2}+\\beta(G)/2$.

For any connected graph $G$, a generic real symmetric matrix supported on $G$ satisfies this nodal count condition. However, the situation for constant diagonal matrices is far more subtle. We completely characterize the graphs $G$ for which this condition is generically true, and show that if this is not the case, then any real symmetric matrix supported on $G$ with constant diagonal has a multiple eigenvalue or an eigenvector that vanishes somewhere. Finally, we discuss what can be said when this nodal count condition fails, and provide examples.",

We next cover the accompanying proofs by George E Andrews of other related Baxter identities arisen of Rogers-Ramanujan type, leading into a new flourishing partnership of Physics and Mathematics. Our narrative goes into the subsequent 44 years, explaining the progress in physics and mathematical analysis. Finally we show some related crossovers with regard to the \\textit{Elliptic q-gamma function} and some \\textit{Vector Partition} generating functional equations; the latter of which may be new. The present paper is essentially chapter 11 of the author's 32 chapter book \\cite{gC2024} to appear in June 2024.",

Starting from a honeycomb lattice of obstacles attaining $120^\\circ$-rotation symmetry and horizontal reflection symmetry, we apply the boundary integral equation method to show the existence of Dirac points for the first two bands at the vertices of the Brillouin zone.\nWe then study interface modes in a joint honeycomb photonic structure, which consists of two periodic lattices obtained by perturbing the honeycomb one with Dirac points differently. The perturbations break the reflection symmetry of the system, as a result, they annihilate the Dirac points and generate two structures with different topological phases, which mimics the quantum valley Hall effect in topological insulators. We investigate the interface modes that decay exponentially away from the interface of the joint structure in several configurations with different interface geometries, including the zigzag interface, the armchair interface, and the rational interfaces.\nUsing the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis, we first characterize the band-gap opening for the two perturbed periodic structures and derive the asymptotic expansions of the Bloch modes near the band gap surfaces. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for each joint honeycomb structure using boundary integral equations over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operators, we prove the existence of interface modes when the perturbation is small.\n\n\\medskip\n{\\textbf{Keywords}:} Interface modes, Honeycomb structure, Helmholtz equations, Dirac points,  Topological photonics\n\n\\medskip\n{\\textbf{MSC}:}35P15, 35Q60, 35J05, 45M05",

The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\\omega^{\\rm (over)}(z)=|z-\\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, so including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\\omega^{\\rm (over)}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\\omega^{\\rm (over)}(z)=|z-\\overline{x}|^2\\omega^{\\rm (pre)}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\\omega^{\\rm (pre)}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\\omega^{\\rm (over)}(z)$ are determined.\nWe also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance  in $\\omega^{\\rm (pre)}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.",

The weights of our measure include factors that are universal symplectic characters, as well as a novel family of ``Down-Up Schur functions\" that we define and for which we prove new identities of Cauchy-Littlewood-type. Our main structural result is that the point process corresponding to the symplectic Schur process is determinantal and we find an explicit correlation kernel.\n    We also present dynamics that preserve the family of symplectic Schur processes and explore an alternative sampling scheme, based on the Berele insertion algorithm, in a special case. Finally, we study the asymptotics of the Berele insertion process and find explicit formulas for the limit shape and fluctuations near the bulk and the edge. One of the limit regimes leads to a new kernel that resembles the symmetric Pearcey kernel.",

    "abstract": "In a recent work, Ringström proposed a geometric notion of initial data on big bang singularities. Moreover, he conjectured that initial data on the singularity could be used to parameterize quiescent solutions to Einstein's equations; that is, roughly speaking, solutions whose leading order asymptotics are convergent. We prove that given initial data on the singularity for the Einstein--nonlinear scalar field equations in $4$ spacetime dimensions, as defined by Ringström, there is a corresponding unique development of the data. We do not assume any symmetry or analyticity, and we allow for arbitrary closed spatial topology. Our results thus present an important step towards resolving Ringström's conjecture. Furthermore, our results show that the Einstein--nonlinear scalar field equations have a geometric singular initial value problem formulation, which is analogous to the classical result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch for initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface.\n\n    In the literature, there are two conditions which are expected to ensure that quiescent behavior occurs. The first one is an integrability condition on a special spatial frame. The second one is an algebraic condition on the eigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map associated with a foliation of the spacetime near the singularity. Our result is the first such result where both possibilities are allowed. That is, we allow for the first condition to ensure quiescence in one region of space and for the second condition to take over in the region where the first one is violated. This fact allows for our results to include the vacuum setting. We expect that all current results in the literature where the authors specify data on a big bang singularity and then construct a corresponding solution, to the Einstein vacuum or Einstein--scalar field equations in $4$ spacetime dimensions, with closed spatial topology, and where the limits of the eigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map are everywhere distinct, should be special cases of our results.",

In this paper we study the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model from a geometric quantization point of view. We show that the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model can be identified with the space of sections of a line bundle on the quiver variety associated to a framed Jordan quiver. We compute the character of the Hilbert space using localization technique. Using a natural isomorphism between vortex moduli space and a Beilinson-Drinfeld Schubert variety, we prove that the ground states wave functions are flat sections of a bundle of conformal blocks associated to a WZW model. In particular they solve a Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. We show that there exists a natural action of the deformed double current algebra (DDCA) on the Hilbert space, moreover the action is irreducible.\n\nWe define and study the conformal limit of the Chern-Simons matrix model.

Due to the coupling of the scalar field to the geometry via the Einstein equations, suitable components of the Ricci tensor exhibit non-decay and growth phenomena along the event horizon.\n\n Points (i) and (ii) above reflect the ``stability'' of the extremal Reissner--Nordstr\\\"om family and points (iii) and (iv) verify the presence of the celebrated \\emph{Aretakis instability} \\cite{Aretakis-instability-2} for the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner--Nordstr\\\"om black holes in the full nonlinear Einstein--Maxwell-scalar field model.",

    "abstract": "Bulk-edge correspondence is a wide-ranging principle that applies to topological matter, as well as a precise result established in a large and growing number of cases. According to the principle, the distinctive topological properties of matter, thought of as extending indefinitely in space, are equivalently reflected in the excitations running along its boundary, when one is present. Indices encode those properties, and their values, when differing, are witness to a violation of that correspondence. We address such violations, as they are encountered in a hydrodynamic context. The model concerns a shallow layer of fluid in a rotating frame and provides a local description of waves propagating either across the oceans or along a coastline; it becomes topological when suitably modified at short distances. The edge index is sensitive to boundary conditions, as exemplified in earlier work, hence exhibiting a violation. Here we present classification of all (local, self-adjoint) boundary conditions and a parameterization of their manifold. They come in four families, distinguished in part by the degree of their underlying differential operators. Essentially, that degree counts the degrees of freedom of the hydrodynamic field that are constrained at the boundary by way of their normal derivatives. Generally, both the correspondence and its violation are typical. Within families though, the maximally possible amount of violation is increasing with its degree. Several indices of interest are charted for all boundary conditions. A single spectral mechanism for the onset of violations is furthermore identified. The role of a symmetry is investigated.",

The contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a greater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion process, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on all coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy principle, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and simulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising free energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.",

In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants associated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas involving summations over non-crossing permutations. The pure and mixed cases involve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the distribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a sum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of higher orders is provided. \n\nTensor freeness is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order tensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic moments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic construction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative probability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of these spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor freeness of the subspaces they generate.",

When the discs are placed along a regular lattice, we derive an effective operator which gives rise to the famous Harper's equation.\nMain challenges in this problem compared to recent results on magnetic tunneling are the fact that one-well ground states have non-trivial angular momentum which depends on the semiclassical parameter, and the existence of eigenvalue crossings.",

The solutions can exhibit interesting rotational features in this non-abstract, visualizable setting, including spinor-like behavior and quasiperiodicity.  The equations are well-behaved at zero, reducing to the simple infinitesimal case there. One of them is equivalent to a known quaternion differential equation. The simple geometric derivation does not depend on Euler's rotation theorem, and yields a proof of Euler's theorem using only infinitesimal motions.  With mild regularity conditions on the angular velocity function, there is a continuous evolution of the normalized axis and angle for all time.

Krichever's Lax matrix for the elliptic Calogero-Moser system from the equivariant cohomology of the moduli space of instantons. This result also has K-theoretic and elliptic cohomology counterparts. Our methods rely upon the so-called $\\theta$-transform of the $qq$-characters vev’s, defined as integrals of certain classes in these cohomology theories. The key step is the non-commutative Jacobi-like product formula for them.  We also obtained a natural answer for the eigenvector of the Lax matrix and the horizontal section for the associated isomonodromic connection in terms of the partition function of folded instantons. As an application of our formula, we demonstrate some progress towards the spectral duality of the many-body systems in question, as well as give a new look at the quantum-classical duality between their trigonometric version and the corresponding spin chains.",

Specifically, we focus on the divergence-form operator with periodic coefficients and prove the equality between the well-known gap Chern number (the bulk invariant) and an edge index defined via a trace formula for the operator restricted to a finite domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the edge index characterizes the circulation of electromagnetic energy along the system's boundary, and the BEC principle is a consequence of energy conservation. The proof leverages Green function techniques and can be extended to other systems. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing robust topological photonic devices with finite geometries, complementing recent advances in discrete models.",

Lieb resolved this conjecture in 1978, posing a similar question for Bloch coherent states of $SU(2)$. The $SU(2)$ conjecture was settled by Lieb and Solovej in 2014, and the conjecture was extended for a wide class of Lie groups. The generalized Lieb conjecture has been resolved for several Lie groups, including $SU(N),\\, N\\geq2$, $SU(1,1)$, and its $AX+B$ subgroup. With sharp functional inequalities for the coherent state transforms of the group $SU(N,1)$, we confirm this Lieb-Wehrl entropy conjecture for $SU(N,1),\\, N\\geq2$. Additionally, we explore the Faber-Krahn inequality, which applies to the short-time Fourier transform with a Gaussian window.

We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension.

This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction.

To our knowledge, the present work is the first to apply the idea and approach in the context of quasi-exactly solvable systems.",

    "abstract": "Since the Ginzburg--Landau theory is concerned with macroscopic phenomena, and gravity affects how objects interact at the macroscopic level. It becomes relevant to study the Ginzburg--Landau theory in curved space, that is, in the presence of gravity. In this paper, some existence theorems are established for the vortex solutions of the magnetic Ginzburg--Landau theory coupled to the Einstein equations. First, when the coupling constant $\\lambda=1$, we get a self--dual structure from the Ginzburg--Landau theory, then a partial differential equation with a gravitational term that has power--type singularities is deduced from the coupled system. To overcome the difficulty arising from the orders of singularities at the vortices, a constraint minimization method and a monotone iteration method are employed. We also show that the quantized flux and total curvature are determined by the number of vortices. Second, when the coupling constant $\\lambda>0$, we use a suitable ansatz to get the radially symmetric case for the magnetic Ginzburg--Landau theory in curved space. The existence of the symmetric vortex solutions are obtained through combining a two--step iterative shooting argument and a fixed-point theorem approach. Some fundamental properties of the solutions are established via applying a series of analysis techniques.",

For any of the brackets in the family, the argument shift determines the compatible linear bracket. The main interest for us is the use of the bi-Hamiltonian formalism for some pencils from this family, as a method for constructing involutive subalgebras for a linear bracket starting by the center of the quadratic bracket. We give some interesting examples of families of this type.\n\nWe construct the centers of the corresponding quadratic brackets using the antidiagonal principal minors of the Lax matrix. Special attention should be paid to the condition of the log-canonicity of the brackets of these minors with all the generators of the Poisson algebra of the family under consideration. A similar property arises in the context of Poisson structures consistent with cluster transformations.",

    "abstract": "Within the framework of the Riemann-Hilbert problem, the theory of inverse scattering transform is established for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with local and nonlocal nonlinearities (which originates from the parity-symmetric reduction of the Manakov\nsystem) under  non-zero boundary conditions. First, the adjoint Lax pair and auxiliary eigenfunctions are introduced for the direct scattering,\nand the analyticity, symmetries of eigenfunctions and scattering matrix are studied in detail.\nThen, the distribution of discrete eigenvalues is examined, and the asymptotic behaviors of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are analyzed\nrigorously. Compared with the Manakov system, the reverse-space nonlocality introduces an additional symmetry, leading to stricter constraints on\neigenfunctions, scattering coefficients and norming constants. Further, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated for the the inverse problem with the scattering coefficients admitting an arbitrary number of simple zeros. For the reflectionless case, the  N-soliton solutions are presented in the determinant form. With N=1, the dark and beating one-soliton solutions are obtained, which are respectively associated with a pair of discrete eigenvalues lying on and off the circle on the spectrum plane. Via the asymptotic  analysis,  the two-soliton solutions are found to admit the interactions between two dark solitons or two beating solitons, as well as the superpositions of two beating solitons or one beating soliton and one dark soliton.\n\n\\vspace{5mm}\n\n\\noindent{Keywords: Inverse scattering transform; Nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation; N-soliton solutions; Riemann-Hilbert method}\\\\[2mm]",
